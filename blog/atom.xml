    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last week was <a href="http://jprime.io" target="_blank" rel="external">jPrime 2016</a>, the biggest Java conference on the Balkans. It was a huge success &mdash; more than 500 visitors, two tracks in two days. The slogan was <em>“Java - 21 and legally drunk”</em> and the two main themes were <strong>microservices</strong> and <strong>reactive programming</strong> with RxJava. This was the second year in a row for the conference which is organized by the community, i.e. fellow Java developers from the BGJUG. By being silver sponsors, we made a humble contribution which helped the community organize this great event.</p>

<p>I really liked the talk by Kees Jan Koster where he explained what it is that distracts us from coding and how we can focus on getting things done and not spend too much time in meetings. Later, Hrvoje Crnjak talked about RxJava and how it could be used to make our applications more reactive. And on the second day I really enjoyed the talk on Go by Stoyan Rachev.</p>

<p>Just before jPrime, we released a <a href="https://github.com/Erudika/para-client-ios" target="_blank" rel="external">client library</a> for Para that works with iOS devices, including tvOS and OS X. It is written in Swift and is <a href="http://cocoadocs.org/docsets/ParaClient" target="_blank" rel="external">published on CocoaPods</a>. We encountered <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/37374778/108758" target="_blank" rel="external">a lot of problems with Xcode and CocoaPods</a> along the way - unstable IDE, poor Objective-C interoperability and poor documentation were slowing us down. Personally, I liked Swift and this was my first time using it, but the overall programming experience with Xcode left in me a feeling of unstability and beta-ness. The developer tools for Java and Android are just superior in comparison, and in a way, I’m glad <a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2016/05/google-wins-trial-against-oracle-as-jury-finds-android-is-fair-use/" target="_blank" rel="external">Java won</a>. </p>
<p>Now you can build iOS apps that are powered by Para on the backend:</p>
<figure class="highlight swift"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">import</span> ParaClient</span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment">// avoid using the secret key on mobile devices</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">let</span> client = <span class="type">ParaClient</span>(accessKey: <span class="string">"ACCESS_KEY"</span>, secretKey:<span class="string">""</span>)</span><br><span class="line">client.signIn(<span class="string">"facebook"</span>, providerToken: <span class="string">"fb_access_token"</span>, callback: &#123; user <span class="keyword">in</span></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">if</span> user != <span class="literal">nil</span> &#123;</span><br><span class="line">        <span class="comment">// success! user is authenticated, JWT token is saved on the device</span></span><br><span class="line">        <span class="comment">// you can now call the API methods</span></span><br><span class="line">    &#125;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;)</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>Finally, we also updated Para to version <code>1.18.5</code> which includes a number of <a href="https://github.com/Erudika/para/releases" target="_blank" rel="external">bug fixes</a>. The release is on Maven Central and you can download the executable <a href="https://github.com/Erudika/para/releases/download/v1.18.5/para-1.18.5.war" target="_blank" rel="external">WAR binary file from GitHub</a>. </p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday we released a simple web management console for Para. It’s open source, client-side only and lets you connect
to any of your Para servers and manage your objects easily through the web interface. It’s powered by AngularJS and
uses the great libraries <a href="https://github.com/marmelab/ng-admin" target="_blank" rel="external">ng-admin</a> and <a href="https://github.com/mgonto/restangular" target="_blank" rel="external">Restangular</a>.
The console works for both local and remotely deployed servers and you are more than welcome to modify it for your needs.
We’d appreciate any <a href="https://github.com/erudika/para-admin-ui" target="_blank" rel="external">pull requests on GitHub</a>.</p>
<a id="more"></a>
<p><img src="/assets/img/pwc1.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Once you connect to Para with your access keys, you see the dashboard where you see some aggregated information about
your app and server. On the left there is a list of object types. These include both core types defined in Java classes
and user-defined types created through the API. To create a custom type from the console, go to the “Edit App view”
and edit the <code>Datatypes</code> field by adding your own type, then refresh the page and it will appear on the left. Also
you can edit the resource permissions for your app.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/img/pwc1_p1.png" alt=""></p>
<p>All types, except Linker (read-only), support CRUD operations in the web console. You can create and edit objects
easily and you can also do full-text search and browse through all the pages of results. We hope to add more
improvements to the project soon, like address visualization on a map and automatic configuration of custom fields.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/img/pwc1_p2.png" alt=""></p>
<p>We’ve also updated Para to v1.18.3 to support the new type of tokens used by the web console. You can now generate
JWTs on the client-side and create “super” tokens from your access keys. These tokens give you full-access to the
API for a limited time, until they expire. They are simple to work with and can be sent as a request header.
Other improvements in this version include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Added support for anonymous permissions and guest access to the API</li>
<li>Fixed default permissions to allow users to access their child objects (object created by them)</li>
<li>Fixed CORS and GZip filters conflicts</li>
</ul>
<p>The admin interface is client-side only and your secret key is <em>never</em> sent over the the network. Instead, a JWT
access token is generated locally and sent to the server on each request (valid for a week).</p>
<p>We created the web console as a supplementary tool to our paid backend management interface on <a href="https://paraio.com" target="_blank" rel="external">paraio.com</a>.
It has all the features of the web console and more - backup and restore, simple permission management
and scalability controls. And we offer free accounts for developers!</p>

    <updated>2016-03-08T22:33:47.183Z</updated>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This past month was interesting and quite busy for us - we got valuable feedback and contributions from our clients,
fixed many bugs, released the <a href="https://github.com/Erudika/para-client-android" target="_blank" rel="external">Android client for Para</a> and a new
plugin for MongoDB. The number one request for this version was support for plugins and MongoDB. We’ve also updated
the documentation of our open source backend framework and redesigned the landing page on
<a href="http://www.paraio.org" target="_blank" rel="external">paraio.org</a>. The docs should now look even better on mobile devices with high-DPI displays.</p>
<a id="more"></a>
<p><img src="/assets/img/blogpost_media3.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Para <strong>v1.18</strong> supports plugins for the three main components in our framework - <code>DAO</code>, <code>Search</code> and <code>Cache</code>. These
three interfaces are the foundation and their implementations define how objects are stored in a database, indexed by
 a search engine or cached in memory. Now you can create your own plugins that implement the <code>DAO</code>, for example,
 like we did for MongoDB. To create a plugin, you simply create a new Java project and import <code>para-core</code> using Maven.
 Then you implement one of the three interfaces above. Finally, put the compiled plugin inside a <code>lib</code> folder relative
 to the <code>para-x.y.z.war</code>. For more information about plugins,
 <a href="http://www.paraio.org/docs/#008-plugins" target="_blank" rel="external">refer to the documentation</a>.</p>
<p>Our <a href="https://github.com/Erudika/para-dao-mongodb" target="_blank" rel="external">para-dao-mongodb</a> plugin is the first official plugin for Para and
it adds support for MongoDB. It was written by <a href="https://github.com/lucav" target="_blank" rel="external">Luca Venturella</a> and works with the latest
Mongo server v3.2. We plan to add more plugins like this for Cassandra, PostgreSQL and others. By writing your own
plugins you can extend and modify the core functionality of Para and make it work for your scenario and the technologies
you use. Here are some of the different possible integrations that can work great as plugins:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>databases</strong> (<code>DAO</code>): Cassandra, PostgreSQL, CouchDB, OrientDB</li>
<li><strong>search systems</strong> (<code>Search</code>): CloudSearch, Solr, Algolia</li>
<li><strong>caches</strong> (<code>Cache</code>): Memcached, Redis, Ehcache, Infinispan</li>
</ul>
<p>In <strong>v1.18</strong> we also improved the permissions API by allowing developers to add permissions on specific objects by <code>id</code>.
The following code, for example, allows a user with id of <code>user1</code> to delete a specific <code>Post</code> object:</p>
<figure class="highlight java"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">paraClient.grantResourcePermission(<span class="string">"user1"</span>, <span class="string">"posts/123"</span>, [<span class="string">"DELETE"</span>]);</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>In addition to this, we added special flags to every <code>ParaObject</code> that control persistence, indexing and caching operations.
These flags are in the form of boolean properties and give you a fine-grained control over every object. You can now
create transient objects that only live in memory (<code>stored: false</code>, <code>indexed: false</code>, <code>cached: true</code>), or objects that
will never be cached (<code>stored: true</code>, <code>indexed: true</code>, <code>cached: false</code>).</p>
<p>The plan for the next few weeks is to add more integrations and a basic web UI, as requested by some of our fellow
developers. We’ll be focusing on making Para work with <a href="https://github.com/marmelab/ng-admin" target="_blank" rel="external">ng-admin</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/mgonto/restangular" target="_blank" rel="external">Restangular</a>, as well as, <strong>iOS</strong>.
And even though we regret the recent news of <a href="http://blog.parse.com/announcements/moving-on/" target="_blank" rel="external">Parse shutting down</a>, we hope
that more web and mobile developers will find <a href="https://paraio.com" target="_blank" rel="external">Para</a> useful and a good alternative to the Parse service.</p>
<h2 id="Meet_us_at_the_jPrime_conference">Meet us at the jPrime conference</h2><p>We’ll be sponsoring <a href="http://jprime.io/" target="_blank" rel="external">jPrime</a> - a local conference with talks on Java, the JVM, mobile, web and best
practices, which will be held on <strong>May 26-27th, 2016</strong> in Sofia, Bulgaria. It’s run by the
<a href="https://jug.bg/en/" target="_blank" rel="external">Bulgarian Java User Group</a> and backed by the biggest software companies in the city. If you’re in
the area and into Java, you should definitely come to jPrime. Send us an email and we’ll arrange for you some Para
stickers on the day of the conference.</p>

    <link href="http://www.erudika.com/blog/2016/01/05/para-1-17-released/"/>
    <id>http://www.erudika.com/blog/2016/01/05/para-1-17-released/</id>
    <published>2016-01-05T16:20:27.000Z</published>
    <updated>2016-03-07T00:33:26.039Z</updated>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We’re happy to announce the release of Para v1.17. Last week we pushed the new version to Maven and now it’s also
deployed on <a href="https://paraio.com" target="_blank" rel="external">ParaIO.com</a>, our hosted backend service.</p>
<a id="more"></a>
<p>We’ve worked hard during the holidays to bring you several new features that will enable you to integrate Para in
projects that are client-side only like static web pages or mobile applications.</p>
<p>Here are all the new features in Para v1.17:</p>
<!--
Added JSON Web Tokens support
Added methods to grant and revoke permissions for users
Fixed Maven's JAR and WAR assembly - there's a single 'fat' executable WAR now
Updated Elasticsearch to v2.1.1
Updated design & added features to web console
-->
<h2 id="JSON_Web_Tokens_support">JSON Web Tokens support</h2><p><img src="/assets/img/blogpost_media2.png" alt=""></p>
<p><a href="http://jwt.io/" target="_blank" rel="external">JSON Web Tokens</a> are a new standard for authenticating clients and users. Think of them as
‘Cookies 2.0’. They are simply a signed JSON object containing some data about the authenticated user. The cool thing
about JWTs is that they are stateless and can be stored anywhere - cookies, local storage, memory, etc. They can securely
store information and claims about the user and that information is signed and cannot be tampered with.</p>
<p>Originally, Para supported only cookies and allowed users to sign in only to the server running Para.
This was quite limiting. Now with JWTs users can be authenticated and created per app
(see <a href="http://www.paraio.org/docs/#011-apps" target="_blank" rel="external">the docs for apps</a>) through the API.
Cookies are still supported but using web tokens is recommended. For example, to sign in a user with
Facebook you have to make a request like this:</p>
<figure class="highlight js"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">POST /v1/jwt_auth</span><br><span class="line">&#123;</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="string">"appid"</span>: <span class="string">"app:myapp"</span>,</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="string">"provider"</span>: <span class="string">"facebook"</span>,</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="string">"token"</span>: <span class="string">"eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eWIiO..."</span></span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>The token above is a Facebook access token which is exchanged for a Para access token in the form of JWT.
If that request succeeds, the access token for Para is returned and that user is now authenticated with <code>app:myapp</code>.</p>
<figure class="highlight js"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br><span class="line">13</span><br><span class="line">14</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">&#123;</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="string">"jwt"</span>: &#123;</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="string">"access_token"</span>: <span class="string">"eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJ..."</span>,</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="string">"expires"</span>: <span class="number">1450137214490</span>,</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="string">"refresh"</span>: <span class="number">1450137216490</span></span><br><span class="line">  &#125;,</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="string">"user"</span>: &#123;</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="string">"id"</span>:<span class="string">"user1"</span>,</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="string">"timestamp"</span>: <span class="number">1399721289987</span>,</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="string">"type"</span>:<span class="string">"user"</span>,</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="string">"appid"</span>:<span class="string">"myapp"</span>,</span><br><span class="line">    ...</span><br><span class="line">  &#125;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>That’s it - there’s no need to register the user. And this request can come from any client not just the backend.
An good use case would be an AngularJS app running on its own as a static single page app (SPA). The frontend code would
use our JavaScript client library to call <code>signIn()</code> to the Para backend server. Another use case could be a mobile app
running native Android code. The app’s code, even though compiled, is not trusted and thus must not contain any
API access credentials like a <code>secret_key</code> for Para. In this case JWT is ideal because it gives that app (untrusted client)
temporary access to the API. Para access tokens are valid for one week, by default.</p>
<p>Special thanks to the guys at <a href="http://connect2id.com/products/nimbus-jose-jwt" target="_blank" rel="external">Connect2ID</a> for their excellent JWT
library for Java which we use in Para.</p>
<h2 id="Resource_permissions">Resource permissions</h2><p>Soon after we decided to add JWT support, we realized that once a user has been authenticated with an app we need to
specify what that user can do, so we implemented basic resource permissions. By default users are not trusted and every
new app has zero permissions - the default policy is <code>deny all</code>. This is in contrast to the normal API access using a
<code>secret_key</code> for apps, in which case apps have full permissions and privileged access.</p>
<p>Resource permissions affect only users with JWT tokens and are stored in each app object. A permission has three parts -
a <code>subject_id</code>, a <code>resource_name</code> and a list of <code>methods</code>. It looks like this:</p>
<figure class="highlight js"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">&#123;</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="string">"user2"</span>: &#123;</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="string">"posts"</span>: [<span class="string">"GET"</span>, <span class="string">"POST"</span>]</span><br><span class="line">  &#125;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>This gives a subject with id <code>user2</code> permissions to access resource <code>posts</code> using HTTP methods <code>GET</code> and <code>POST</code> only.
The <code>posts</code> resource is just an example an is part of the API and is located at <code>/v1/posts</code>. Wildcards <code>*</code> are also
supported. So the following permission would give everyone full access to all resources for a given app:</p>
<figure class="highlight js"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">&#123;</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="string">"*"</span>: &#123;</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="string">"*"</span>: [<span class="string">"*"</span>]</span><br><span class="line">  &#125;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>Permissions can be granted and revoked through the API. There’s also a method for checking permissions:</p>
<figure class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">GET /v1/_permissions/&#123;subjectid&#125;/&#123;resource&#125;/&#123;method&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<h2 id="Support_for_Elasticsearch_2-x">Support for Elasticsearch 2.x</h2><p>Elasticseach is a key component of the Para backend server and we use it since version 0.13. With version 2.0 come many
new features and changes. We’ve modified and tested the code to be compatible with the new version.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://github.com/Erudika/para/releases/" target="_blank" rel="external">download the latest WAR file from GitHub</a>.
To run it just type <code>java -jar para-war.war</code> and it will start.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Let’s have a look at some modern open source backend frameworks that are available today. These frameworks act as your
server-side component of your website or app. Developers use them to build and iterate on products faster than ever
before by focusing on the “fun” part - the frontend (client-side).</p>
<a id="more"></a>
<p>The communication between your front-end code and the backend is usually done through HTTP(S) and the data is usually
in the form of JSON objects that are sent back and forth. The details about the whole process should be well documented
and part of the REST API documentation.</p>
<p>So why use a backend framework instead of writing my own? The main good reason is that these frameworks are packaged
as reusable components and are tried and tested by many developers. So instead of maintaining another piece of code -
the one you wrote yourself - you can use a package that’s already out there and maintained for you.</p>
<p>Some BaaS frameworks are designed with focus on mobile app development (mBaaS) and some are more generic for building
anything from websites to desktop software or games. The ones that target mobile apps usually have features like
realtime push, notifications support and client libraries for Android and iOS. We’ll cover both types of frameworks here.</p>
<h2 id="UserGrid"><a href="http://usergrid.apache.org" target="_blank" rel="external">UserGrid</a> <a href="https://github.com/apache/usergrid" target="_blank" rel="external"><i class="fa fa-github-square"></i></a></h2><p><img src="/assets/img/usergrid.png"></p>
<p><strong>Multitenant:</strong> yes <br>
<strong>Language:</strong> Java <br>
<strong>Database:</strong> Cassandra <br>
<strong>Documentation:</strong> 9/10 <br>
<strong>Client libraries:</strong> Android, iOS, JavaScript, Ruby, Java, .NET, PHP</p>
<p>Usergrid is an Apache backend-as-a-service project built with Java. It’s been around since 2011 and is actively
developed and maintained. The new version 2.0 is yet to be released and will require both Cassandra and Elasticsearch
in addition to a queue system like AWS SQS.</p>
<p>The project is very well documented but getting started involves quite a few steps. First you need to install Cassandra
and a servlet container like Tomcat. Then you deploy the WAR file to Tomcat and call a special URL to create a superuser
account which gives you access to the web-based console.</p>
<p>The API allows you to create and run multiple apps, which is a good thing because you might want to have a couple of
apps sharing the same backend and this also makes deployment easier. You also get all the basic CRUD functionality for
working with collections and entities (JSON objects). There are several built-in entity types like <code>user</code>, <code>group</code> and
<code>application</code>, for example. They all have <code>type</code> and <code>uuid</code> properties and the latter is an actual UUID string. Basic
entity relationships are also supported. Usergrid has good support for user and file management and has a simple
data model.</p>
<p>Authentication is implemented through OAuth 2.0 and it makes a distinction between user and app roles. Social login
is supported but it appears that only Facebook login works out-of-the-box. Other extra features include geolocation
queries and push notifications (in v2.0).</p>
<p>Usergrid is an excellent choice if you are building a mobile application or an enterprise-grade backend service in
your organization. It is used in production by quite a few companies.</p>
<h2 id="LoopBack"><a href="http://loopback.io" target="_blank" rel="external">LoopBack</a> <a href="https://github.com/strongloop/loopback" target="_blank" rel="external"><i class="fa fa-github-square"></i></a></h2><p><img src="/assets/img/loopback.png"></p>
<p><strong>Multitenant:</strong> no <br>
<strong>Language:</strong> JavaScript <br>
<strong>Database:</strong> agnostic <br>
<strong>Documentation:</strong> 9/10 <br>
<strong>Client libraries:</strong> Android/Java, iOS, JavaScript <br></p>
<p>LoopBack is a Node.js API framework by StrongLoop, part of IBM. It’s been around since 2013 and is actively developed
and has great commercial support. It is focused on REST API development and provides a visual editor for editing and
deploying apps. Mobile app developers will love the Android and iOS SDKs and the push system.</p>
<p>The developer docs are extensive and clear but sometimes slow to navigate. Getting started is easy and there’s a
Yeaoman-based scaffolding tool for generating new project skeletons. Developers have a great choice of database
connectors for all major SQL databases and MongoDB. For development you can also use an in-memory db.</p>
<p>The flexibility of JavaScript is great for quickly developing apps with less boilerplate code. LoopBack helps
with that further by providing a handy model generator for building your classes quickly. These can be validated
with the built-in validation methods. Entity relationships are very well supported. The security model is complex
with user roles, principals and ACLs.</p>
<p>Basic user authentication is part of the core and third-party login support can be implemented using Passport
modules. There’s also a module for OAuth. Geolocation, push and file services are built-in. For anything else
there’s <code>npm</code> and tons of modules on GitHub.</p>
<p>LoopBack is great for REST API service generation and very rapid prototyping. Developers can get up and running in
minutes by building a custom API using the given CLI tool. LoopBack is a very good fit for all projects written in
JavaScript.</p>
<h2 id="Para"><a href="https://paraio.org" target="_blank" rel="external">Para</a> <a href="https://github.com/Erudika/para" target="_blank" rel="external"><i class="fa fa-github-square"></i></a></h2><p><img src="/assets/img/paraio.png" style="border: 1px solid #CCCCCC"></p>
<p><strong>Multitenant:</strong> yes <br>
<strong>Language:</strong> Java <br>
<strong>Database:</strong> agnostic <br>
<strong>Documentation:</strong> 9/10 <br>
<strong>Client libraries:</strong> Java, JavaScript, .NET, PHP, Android, iOS <br></p>
<p>Para is our own little backend framework. It is powered by Java and was released in early 2014. Out of the box, Para
integrates with Elasticsearch and DynamoDB and Hazelcast but developers are not limited to using these defaults.
The design is flexible enough so that anyone can implement the interfaces for search, persistence and caching functionality.
We have plans to include connectors for <a href="https://github.com/Erudika/para-dao-mongodb" target="_blank" rel="external">MongoDB</a> (done!) and Cassandra soon.</p>
<p>Para is focused on simplicity and flexibility and it can host multiple apps on a single server. Although you can use
it to power your mobile backend, we wanted to make the framework simpler by providing the core functionality and thus
we created a general-purpose BaaS. Some of our clients are using it as an API server for their Angular frontend, while
others use it as an alternative to Parse for their mobile development.</p>
<p>The <a href="www.paraio.org/docs">documentation</a> is great, contained in a single webpage for easy navigation and API methods
are described clearly. Getting started is pretty easy - download the executable WAR package and run it:
<figure class="highlight bash"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">$ java -jar para-x.y.z.war</span><br><span class="line">$ curl localhost:<span class="number">8080</span>/v1/_setup</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p>
<p>This will give you the keys needed for making authenticated requests to the server using any of our API clients.
If you wish to integrate Para with your own code, there’s a package on Maven central - just search for <code>para-server</code>.
The WAR file can also be deployed to inside a servlet container like Tomcat.</p>
<p>The core API consists of three main interfaces for searching, storing and caching object. Implement those and you
have your own custom server. The data model is simple and all classes implement the <code>ParaObject</code> interface. This gives
them some basic properties like <code>id</code>, <code>type</code> and <code>name</code>. Entities can link to other entities by forming one-to-one,
one-to-many and many-to-many relationships. Basic constraint checkers, such as <code>required</code>, <code>min</code>, <code>max</code>, <code>regexp</code>,
can be used to validate object properties. Full-text search is enabled by default for all objects.</p>
<p>Authentication between clients and the server is not based on OAuth, <a href="http://hueniverse.com/2012/07/26/oauth-2-0-and-the-road-to-hell/" target="_blank" rel="external">intentionally</a>.
Instead we implement the simple and robust AWS Signature 4 algorithm for signed requests. User management, fine-grained
permissions and support for JSON Web Tokens are available since version 1.17. Para also has built-in support for third-party
authentication with Facebook, Twitter, Google+, GitHub and LinkedIn.</p>
<p>Para is a good choice if you are building a cloud-based web service and it’s great for rapid prototyping.
It’s an easy-to-use and flexible platform that scales well. A backend for busy developers.</p>
<h2 id="BaasBox"><a href="http://www.baasbox.com" target="_blank" rel="external">BaasBox</a> <a href="https://github.com/baasbox/baasbox" target="_blank" rel="external"><i class="fa fa-github-square"></i></a></h2><p><img src="/assets/img/baasbox.png"></p>
<p><strong>Multitenant:</strong> yes, <a href="http://www.baasbox.com/the-importance-of-managing-multiple-apps-with-one-backend" target="_blank" rel="external">since v0.8.4</a> <br>
<strong>Language:</strong> Java <br>
<strong>Database:</strong> OrientDB <br>
<strong>Documentation:</strong> 9/10 <br>
<strong>Client libraries:</strong> Android/Java, iOS, JavaScript <br></p>
<p>BaasBox is another mBaaS with a nice web-based admin console. It supports everything a mobile developer would
need to run a backend server. It’s been around since early 2013. It provides good support for Android and iOS
clients and JavaScript.</p>
<p>The docs are very nice and detailed, very easy to navigate. Getting started is very easy - unzip the file and run
the Bash/bat script and you open up the console on <code>localhost:9000/console</code>.  The server is running on top of OrientDB
which is sort of a hybrid database and has a lot of cool features.</p>
<p>BaasBox is easy to learn and has a nice REST API that speaks JSON. It’s got full support for CRUD operations on objects
and collections of objects and also allows you to link them in one-to-many or many-to-many relationships. Social
features are excellent - you have social login, friendship/followers API and user management. Other features include
files and assets API, push notifications and a plugin system.</p>
<p>BaasBox is a good choice as a mBaaS for building mobile backend services. If you are a mobile app developer
definitely consider BaasBox for your backend.</p>
<h2 id="Deployd"><a href="http://deployd.com" target="_blank" rel="external">Deployd</a> <a href="https://github.com/deployd/deployd" target="_blank" rel="external"><i class="fa fa-github-square"></i></a></h2><p><img src="/assets/img/deployd.png" style="border: 1px solid #CCCCCC"></p>
<p><strong>Multitenant:</strong> no <br>
<strong>Language:</strong> JavaScript <br>
<strong>Database:</strong> MongoDB <br>
<strong>Documentation:</strong> 7/10 <br>
<strong>Client libraries:</strong> none <br></p>
<p>Deployd is an API building platform for Node.js and runs on top of MongoDB. It’s been around since 2012. The cool
thing about it is its web dashboard and the CLI tool called <code>dpd</code>. The framework, it seems, was designed to be used
as part of your project only, i.e. not as a standalone external API server, and has no client libraries available
(tell me if I’m wrong!).</p>
<p>The project is well documented and has plenty of examples and code. They have dedicated installers for Windows and Mac
that will help you get started. To create a new project you run <code>$ dpd create my-app</code> and then start the server
with <code>dpd -d</code>. That’s it.</p>
<p>Deployd plays well with other JavaScript frameworks like AngularJS and Backbone.js. It has great support for
collections (plain old JS objects) and events. Events can be emitted and processed easily. User management is
built-in. Other functionality like social login support is provided by third-party modules.</p>
<p>Deployd is good for those who like a nice web admin UI and build JavaScript apps with Node.js. If you like
MongoDB and Node.js, you’ll love Deployd!</p>
<h2 id="Telepat"><a href="http://telepat.io" target="_blank" rel="external">Telepat</a> <a href="https://github.com/telepat-io/telepat-api" target="_blank" rel="external"><i class="fa fa-github-square"></i></a></h2><p><img src="/assets/img/telepat.png"></p>
<p><strong>Multitenant:</strong> yes <br>
<strong>Language:</strong> JavaScript <br>
<strong>Database:</strong> agnostic <br>
<strong>Documentation:</strong>  6/10 <br>
<strong>Client libraries:</strong> Android, iOS, JavaScript <br></p>
<p>Telepat is the youngest framework of the bunch. It’s a realtime data sync solution for mobile and other applications.
It’s fairly new -  first released in 2015. The framework is focused on realtime push and flexibility. It’s database
agnostic but seems to be designed to work with NoSQL databases like Couchbase. Search is
implemented on top of Elasticsearch.</p>
<p>The documentation is a work in progress but looks great. The early stage of the project means that we should
expect some changes to the API. Getting started requires you to launch Elasticsearch, Redis and Kafka servers
first but they provide a nice Docker package that will help you with that.</p>
<p>The API is simple with CRUD methods for users and applications. User management is supported and authentication is
implemented with passwords and tokens.</p>
<p>Telepat is really new but shows a lot of potential. Lots of new features are planned and others are almost finished
like push notifications. It’s well worth checking out especially if you’re building realtime apps.</p>
<h2 id="Summary">Summary</h2><p>We’ve shown how developers can leverage open source backend frameworks to accelerate time-to-market and enhance
their products’ security and scalability. While some frameworks cater to mobile developers and make very specific
choices in terms of technology stack, other try to have broader use cases and be database-agnostic.</p>
<p>In order to decide which BaaS package is best for your project, start by defining its scope and platform - is it
going to be a mobile app or a website, for example. Then choose the framework that has the best documentation and
client library for your specific platform and language - C#, Java, Javascript, etc. Finally get the code and run it
locally on your development machine and give it a try.</p>
<p>Happy coding!</p>
