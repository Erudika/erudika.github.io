I've assembled a list of the top open source Q&A platforms that are currently available. The list contains
only projects which are in **active development** and have a working demo site. There are a few similar blog
posts out there but they're quite outdated. Most of the projects listed below are inspired by Stack Overflow
which is in fact the most popular community for questions and answers related to programming. Please, bear
in mind that **the list is not ordered in any way**.
