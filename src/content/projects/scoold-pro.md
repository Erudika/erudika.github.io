**Scoold Pro**, the paid version of Scoold, has premium features which make it the perfect knowledge sharing platform for
your company or team.

Scoold can run anywhere - Heroku, DigitalOcean, AWS, Azure or any VPS hosting provider. It's lightweight (~7000 LOC),
the backend is handled by a separate service called Para. All the heavy lifting is
delegated to Para which can also be configured to store the data in any of the popular databases. This makes the Scoold
code base easy to read and can be learned quickly, even by junior developers.
