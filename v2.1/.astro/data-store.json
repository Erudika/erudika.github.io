We've been working\non it for the past few months and we can't wait for you to try it out. Now you can easily deploy a Scoold Pro\nserver in the cloud. Scaling and upgrades are handled by us, leaving you to focus on your community. When used in\ncombination with our serverless backend, [Para](https://paraio.com), Scoold Cloud offers a simple and efficient\nsolution for knowledge sharing within your organization, with zero maintainance.\n\n\u003C!-- more -->\n\n![](/src/images/blogpost_media16.png)\n\n## Deploy Scoold Pro in minutes\n\nHosting Scoold Pro yourself can be challenging especially if you don't have prior experience with hosting Java\napplications in the cloud. Many of our clients have asked us for help during the installation process and some\neven got stuck along the way because they are not familiar with the platform they are using.\nYou are faced with many choices while deploying Scoold - you have to choose one of the many cloud providers\n(AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform, Heroku, DigitalOcean, etc.). Then, you can either choose to go with Docker\nor run the application directly. So we decided to simplify the whole process and offer Scoold as a service.\nScoold Cloud makes the deployment process effortless - it takes just a few clicks to run a fresh instance of\nScoold Pro.\n\nLet's run a new Scoold Pro server. First, visit [cloud.scoold.com](https://cloud.scoold.com/login) and register.\nAfter login, click \"New Deployment\" on the Servers page. Let's choose a \"SMALL\" instance type and, since we don't\nhave a Para app yet, check the \"Use demo app for now\" checkbox. This will connect to a demo Para app filled with\nexample questions and answers.\n\n\u003Cvideo width=\"100%\" autoplay loop>\n  \u003Csource src=\"/assets/vid/scooldcloud1.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\">\n\u003C/video>\n\nScoold Cloud runs on top of Amazon Web Services (AWS) and when you click \"Deploy\" it spins up one or multiple\nEC2 instances along with a load balancer and sets up autoscaling automatically. Finally, it connects your cluster\nto the internet by setting up your own `.cloud.scoold.com` subdomain with SSL enabled. The whole process takes\nabout 4-5 minutes.\n\n\u003Cvideo width=\"100%\" autoplay loop>\n  \u003Csource src=\"/assets/vid/scooldcloud2.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\">\n\u003C/video>\n\nYou can view basic metrics in realtime like request count, response times and HTTP error count. You can also edit\nthe configuration file directly in your browser. Finally, you can terminate a server completely, thus releasing its\nresources. Terminating a server **does not delete your data** in Para so you can simply redeploy the instance and\nall your data will be there.\n\n\n## Migration from Stack Overflow for Teams to Scoold Cloud\n\n1. Open your Scoold Pro website and login as admin\n2. Download your data archive from Stack Overflow by browsing to 'Admin settings -> Account info -> Download data'\n3. On Scoold's Administration page click 'Import' and select the Stack Overflow archive (.zip)\n4. Check \"This archive was exported from Stack Overflow\" and click import\n\nAll the data for your team on Stack Overflow, except for user badges, will be imported into Scoold.\n\n## Migrating your existing Scoold server to Scoold Cloud\n\n1. Deploy a new Scoold Pro server on Scoold Cloud\n2. Open the `application.conf` file of your existing Scoold server and copy its contents\n3. Paste the configuration inside the \"Configuration\" panel for your Scoold Cloud instance\n4. Restart your Scoold Cloud instance\n\nKeep in mind that for this operation to work you need to have Para deployed on a publicly accessible location.\nIf you use hosted Para (ParaIO.com) this won't be an issue, but if your Para is deployed on a private server or\non your local machine, Scoold Cloud will not be able to connect and your Scoold instance will appear broken.\n\n\n## Subscription plans\n\n![](/src/images/scooldcloud_pricing.png)\n\nScoold Cloud pricing starts from &euro;49/month for a single node deployment. For a load-balanced cluster of two nodes\nwith high availability and failover, the price per month is &euro;79/month. For larger installations you can deploy a\n4 node cluster for &euro;129/month. You can deploy as many instances as you like by purchasing deployment credits\nfrom your \"Account\" page.\n\nBilling is on a monthly basis. The prices don't include European Union VAT (not applicable to customers outside the EU).\n\n\n*Need a Para backend for your Scoold Pro server?

Scoold Pro fits well inside an enterprise environment and can also be hosted on your company's intranet. SAML authentication allows for a faster onboarding and unlimited spaces give you the freedom to assign a separate space to each one of your teams within your organization.\n\n\u003C!-- more -->\n\n![](/src/images/blogpost_media10.png)\n\nScoold was launched more than a year ago and so far has been quite successful as Stack Overflow clone. It quickly became one of the [top open source SO clones out there](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2267/stack-exchange-clones).\n\n![](/src/images/pro_i18n.png)\n\nPeople from all around the world deploying Scoold in production and it got a few hundred stars on GitHub (thanks!). Also our generous contributors have translated Scoold in more than 10 languages, including Chinese and Hindi.\n\n## Development in the past year\n\nIn the past year we were busy adding features to the open source version and we have fixed a ton of issues and improved the documentation. Scoold is now on [Docker](https://hub.docker.com/r/erudikaltd/scoold/) and it's really easy to get it up and running quickly. The most notable features were \"Spaces\" and LDAP authentication support. Spaces are essentially isolated groups where people can ask/answer questions which are relevant only to that specific group. For example, we could create a space called \"Dev team\" and add all our software developers to it. The best part of this is that spaces are free! Most of the SO clones will charge your for this feature and in Scoold it's open source and available to everyone.\n\nLDAP support was also in high demand so we implemented it in both [Para](https://paraio.org) and Scoold. It's now possible to connect to your existing LDAP directory and sign in users effortlessly. Active Directory is also supported. Additionally, we've implemented OAuth 2.0 authentication so that your users can login through any OAuth/OpenID Connect identity provider.\n\nAs feature requests started piling up, we decided to release a paid version and continue adding new features to it. Both the open source and paid versions will continue to be actively maintained and developed in parallel. The pricing model for Scoold Pro is quite straightforward and we don't care how many users you have. We charge a one-time fee for 1 year of updates, per server.\n\nSo, let's go over the Pro features.\n\n## Sticky / Favorite posts\n\n![](/src/images/pro_favs.png)\n\n\nThese are two small features so we combined them into one. Sticky posts are a useful little feature which allows you to highlight important questions and announcements. This feature is typically found in forum software and basically \"pins\" a post to the top of the page. You can also \"like\" any question which adds it to your favorites so that you can later go back to that question quickly.\n\n\n## SAML support\n\n![](/src/images/pro_saml.png)\n\n\nThis is an enterprise feature allow Scoold to talk to your corporate identity servers enabling people to login with SAML. Scoold acts as a service provider (SP) for your identity provider (IDP). There are quite a few options to configure here so you must know what you're doing.\n\n\n## Anonymous posts\n\nAnonymous posts are useful if you want to make onboarding easier. It lowers the barrier for new users and increases engagement. When enabled, new users will be able to ask and answer questions without a registration. On such anonymous posts, the author is displayed as \"Anonymous\". This feature is disabled by default.\n\n## Unlimited spaces\n\nSpaces are normally limited to 10, but in Pro this limit goes away. You can assign a space to each team or department in your organization. By default there's a public \"default\" space where all questions go. When you create a new space and assign users to it they will still see all the other questions when they switch to the \"default\" space.\n\n## Multiple admins and identity domains\n\nYou are no longer limited to a single admin user. Administrators can also promote anyone to become an admin or a moderator. You can also specify all your company domains in the configuration and restrict new registrations to users with emails only from those whitelisted domains.\n\n## Advanced syntax highlighting\n\n![](/src/images/pro_syntax.png)\n\n\nThe syntax highlighting of code snippets has been enhanced and supports additional languages like LaTeX, Velocity, WebAssembly, JSX/TSX and PL/SQL. MathJax integration is also available by turning on its feature flag.\n\n\n## Image uploads\n\nWith image uploads, people can upload screenshots and embed them in their posts. Uploaded image files can have maximum size of 2 MB. Image uploads are handled by Imgur. In the future, more upload services could be supported such as S3. To initiate a new image upload, open up the Markdown editor and drag'n'drop the image you want to upload. A link will automatically appear when the upload is finished. For this feature to work correctly you have to specify your Imgur API client ID.\n\n## Security notifications\n\nScoold has had a strict Content Security Policy and reports since the very beginning. In Pro we've taken this a step further and added email notifications for admins. Administrators and moderators will receive an email when a new report comes in. They can also receive an email report each time the Content Security Policy (CSP) gets violated.\n\nScoold Pro is available for purchase from [scoold.com](https://scoold.com). It's *299 EUR, one-time fee* so you can buy it once and host it on one of your servers indefinitely. You're also eligible for free updates and fixes for a period of 1 year. Buying Pro would also support the development of Scoold in general. Cheers!\n\n\n*Want to give Scoold a try?

Well, this one is for you! Scoold is a cloud-ready Stack Overflow clone, powered by our Para backend. It's a real-world application, showcasing the Para technology and how it can be utilized to get a project off the ground quickly. Scoold is a lightweight (~4000 LOC) web application written in Java -- it runs great on the smallest Heroku dyno and doesn't require a database.\n\n\u003C!-- more -->\n\n![](/src/images/blogpost_media9.png)\n\n# A brief history of Scoold\n\nI started the project back in 2008. Initially, the idea was to build a social network for schools. Yeah, I know, another Facebook, right? Kinda. The project was already in development around the time when Stack Overflow (SO) launched and I was really inspired by it. In the beginning SO was just this one website and had no themed versions of itself, so I decided to build a version of it for students and teachers, instead of programmers. The project was unsucessful but it gave birth to another project which is now known as [Para](https://paraio.org). Scoold's backend code was extracted to a separate library, refactored and published on GitHub and Maven.\n\nSo, for the past few years I was busy developing Para, while Scoold just sat there on my hard drive, doing nothing. I knew it could be useful to somebody and I started refactoring and modernizing it, in January. By mid-February it was out on [GitHub](https://github.com/Erudika/scoold) and redeployed on Heroku (previously it ran on EC2). I've reduced the code significantly by removing old features and just focused on making it work like Stack Overflow.\n\n# Features\n\nSo, what can you do on Scoold? It implements most the SO features -- you can ask and answer questions, upvote and downvote posts, earn badges and reputation. Each edit creates an new revision, making it easy to follow the history of edits. The posts can be written in Markdown, which is then rendered by Para to HTML.\nThe reputation system is simple but effective. People are awarded reputation points for good questions and answers, as well as various badges for their achievements on the site. Not all badges found on SO are implemented, though.\n\n![](/src/images/scoold.png)\n\nWhen posting a question, you can attach a location to it -- a nifty feature which is *not* implemented on Stack Overflow. This allows you to filter questions based on their location, making it easy to find those that have been asked in your region. Geolocation queries are implemented through the Elasticsearch `geo_point` data type.\n\n![](/src/images/scoold1.png)\n\nYou can search for anything on Scoold because each post is indexed and analyzed by Elasticsearch -- a powerful search engine. You can easily find users, questions and answers from the search bar on top. The search results are paginated, each page showing 30 results (this can be changed in the config file).\n\n![](/src/images/scoold2.png)\n\nI really wanted to keep things simple on the frontend -- a classic, light frontend with jQuery works fine. Scoold used jQuery from the very beginning, and the trusted JavaScript library is still very useful today. It takes care of all theAJAX requests and toggles a bunch of elements on the screen, nothing more. Everything is rendered on the server, just like in the good old days. The content is easily crawlable by search engines which is great for SEO and the URLs are pretty tidy, too.\n\nThe design has been completely revamped to have a clean and modern look. The frontend code uses Materialize CSS -- a framework based on Google's Material Design Lite. It's responsive and beautiful. Icons are from FontAwesome. On your profile page you can choose your own picture of use your Gravatar. Logging in is quick, without registration forms or passwords. Initially, Facebook and Google are supported as identity providers, but others are also available, like Microsoft, Twitter and Github (supported by Para).\n\n# Deployment\n\nScoold, is ready for cloud deployment and can run on any cloud infrastructure or on your own servers. Currently, it runs on Heroku. You can simply click the 'Deploy to Heroku' button below and get up-and-running in minutes. It is a single JAR file (generated by Spring Boot) that is executed like this:\n\n```\njava -Dserver.port=$PORT -jar target/scoold*.jar\n```\nThere are a few environment variables that need to be set before deployment. You can find these under the \"Settings\" tab for your application, click \"Reveal Config Vars\".\nThe most important ones are these:\n\n```\npara_endpoint = \"https://paraio.com\"\npara_access_key = \"app:scoold\"\npara_secret_key = \"*****************\"\npara_fb_app_id = \"123456789\"\npara_fb_secret = \"***********************\"\npara_google_client_id = \"********************************\n```\nScoold needs to know the location of a Para server, and to connect, you need your app's access key and secret key (see [Para docs](https://paraio.org/docs)).\n\n[![ click here to deploy ](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/Erudika/scoold)\n\n**The website of the project is [https://scoold.com](https://scoold.com), and the live demo is at [https://demo.scoold.com](https://demo.scoold.com).**\n\n\n*You can follow Scoold [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/getscoold) or chat with us about it [on Gitter](https://gitter.im/Erudika/scoold).*","src/content/blog/Introducing-Scoold-an-open-source-Q-and-A-platform.md","5eb952c8201f0991",{"html":138,"metadata":139},"\u003Cp>Have you ever wanted to have a Q&#x26;A section on your website with the functionality of Stack Overflow?

As we transition our focus from mobile to broader IoT development, the need for reliable and open source backend systems increases. There are so many applications for IoT — smart thermostats, air conditioning controllers, DIY home automation systems based on Raspberry Pi and Arduino, to name a few. We were planning to add IoT support to Para for a while now but it was only after a fellow developer's suggestion that we realized we should've done this sooner. \n\n\u003C!-- more -->\n\n![](/src/images/blogpost_media6.png)\n\nThere are several key players in terms of IoT cloud platforms, but we chose to focus on two — **AWS** and **Azure**. In Para `1.20.0` we've implemented basic support for both platforms which allows you to keep your devices in sync between your backend and the cloud. There's a new object called `Thing` which holds all the information about your device — the state of the device, the security credentials for the cloud and other important data. When a `Thing` is created, Para automatically calls the cloud provider and sets it up, returning all the information you need to connect your device to that cloud. It can then start pushing state changes and messages to the cloud containing any sensory data or other data of interest. In the case of AWS, Para would check for state changes on every read request and in the case of Azure it runs a separate thread for listening to cloud-to-device messages and updates `Thing` objects in the background. If you prefer one of these two approaches, we'd love to hear your feedback. \n\nCreating things from the Para API is really simple — you only need to configure your access keys for the cloud provider of your choice. Then you make a `POST` request:\n\n```\nPOST /v1/things\n{\n  \"name\": \"RPiThingy\",\n  \"serviceBroker\": \"AWS\"\n}\n```\n\nThe `serviceBroker` switches between IoT service providers and can either be \"AWS\" or \"Azure\". The request above will perform several tasks on AWS before it returns, it will:\n \n- Create a device certificate\n- Create a device policy and attach it to the certificate above\n- Create a new thing (device) and attach it to the certificate above\n\nFinally, a new `Thing` object is created within Para. The returned JSON object contains the inlined certificate and private key which should be transferred to the physical device. Once it starts sending data to AWS using the MQTT protocol you can poll for device state changes by reading the `Thing` object:\n\n```\nGET /v1/things/myapp:664870213421895680\n```\n\nAWS have what they call \"device shadows\" a persistent storage for device state which is useful for remembering what was the last state of the device if it ever got disconnected. Let's assume that this shadow has been updated by our Raspberry Pi thingy and it set a `temp = 24` variable. Once we read object like we did above, it gets the latest state from AWS. \n\n```\n{\n  \"id\": \"664870213421895680\",\n  \"timestamp\": 1468601996535,\n  \"type\": \"thing\",\n  \"appid\": \"myapp\",\n  \"name\": \"RPiThingy\"\n  \"serviceBroker\": \"AWS\",\n  \"deviceState\": {\n  \t\"temp\": 24\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIf we make a change in our backend and change the `Thing` to have `temp = 26` then this change is automatically reflected on AWS and the shadow of the device is also updated.\n\n```\nPATCH /v1/things/myapp:664870213421895680\n{\n  \"deviceState\": {\n    \"temp\": 26\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Summary — getting started with Para and AWS IoT\n\n1. Get an account from AWS and create a user with permissions to call the IoT API\n2. Set the `para.aws_access_key` and `para.aws_secret_key` properties in your Para config file\n3. Start the Para instance and create a `Thing` object through the API as shown above\n4. Take note of the `deviceDetails` field returned by this request as it contains certificates for your device\n5. Use the certificates to set up your device and connect it to AWS IoT\n6. The `deviceState` field inside the Para `Thing` object is synced with the device shadow on AWS on every `GET` request\n7. Update the deviceState from the Para API and it will be synced with the device shadow on AWS on every `PATCH` request.\n\n## Other changes since `1.20` and plans for the next release\n\nWe've released quite a few improvements in `1.19` like the implementation of \"join-like\" queries using the method `findLinkedObjects()` this allows you to search for objects within a set of linked objects, in a many-to-many relationship. This feature relies on the `nested` query in Elasticsearch. \n\nPara now works with Microsoft accounts so you can authenticate users with valid Windows accounts. Additionally, we've added independent social sign in for apps with their own OAuth keys, meaning that each app in Para has its own private settings and these can contain security credentials for Facebook, Twitter, etc. This was not possible before for apps other than the root app. Hence, the new endpoint `/v1/_settings` was added for updating these new app settings. The full changelog can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/Erudika/para/releases).\n\nFor the next release we're hoping to implement a new Cassandra `DAO`, which is now overdue. An interesting fact about Para is that it was originally implemented to only run on top of Cassandra as a database layer. This was back in days when Cassandra was below version 1.0 and had no official client library, instead we used the Hector client. Para is now database-agnostic but we really wanted to rewrite the original connector for Cassandra using the official Java drivers. \n\n*Have ideas for the next Para release?

As we transition our focus from mobile to broader IoT development, the need for reliable and open source backend systems increases. There are so many applications for IoT — smart thermostats, air conditioning controllers, DIY home automation systems based on Raspberry Pi and Arduino, to name a few. We were planning to add IoT support to Para for a while now but it was only after a fellow developer’s suggestion that we realized we should’ve done this sooner.\u003C/p>\n\u003C!-- more -->\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"/src/images/blogpost_media6.png\" alt=\"\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>There are several key players in terms of IoT cloud platforms, but we chose to focus on two — \u003Cstrong>AWS\u003C/strong> and \u003Cstrong>Azure\u003C/strong>. In Para \u003Ccode>1.20.0\u003C/code> we’ve implemented basic support for both platforms which allows you to keep your devices in sync between your backend and the cloud. There’s a new object called \u003Ccode>Thing\u003C/code> which holds all the information about your device — the state of the device, the security credentials for the cloud and other important data. When a \u003Ccode>Thing\u003C/code> is created, Para automatically calls the cloud provider and sets it up, returning all the information you need to connect your device to that cloud. It can then start pushing state changes and messages to the cloud containing any sensory data or other data of interest. In the case of AWS, Para would check for state changes on every read request and in the case of Azure it runs a separate thread for listening to cloud-to-device messages and updates \u003Ccode>Thing\u003C/code> objects in the background. If you prefer one of these two approaches, we’d love to hear your feedback.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Creating things from the Para API is really simple — you only need to configure your access keys for the cloud provider of your choice.

These\nthree interfaces are the foundation and their implementations define how objects are stored in a database, indexed by\n a search engine or cached in memory. Now you can create your own plugins that implement the `DAO`, for example,\n like we did for MongoDB.

It is perfect for write-intensive workflows and low-latency queries. Its main advantages are the adjustable read and write performance and global secondary indexes (GSI).\n\nWe migrated from Cassandra to DynamoDB a while back. This decision was taken mainly because of the tunable performance and also because it's a managed service and we had one less thing to maintain. Later we found out that global indexes could help us save a lot of extra costs and so we implemented a simple solution, which we call \"shared tables\".\n\n\u003C!-- more -->\n\n![](/src/images/blogpost_media7.png)\n\nOur solution is applicable to cases where you have a large number of Dynamo tables but each of these has a low utilization. For example, it may contain a few hundred items and have low throughput capacity of 1 read and 1 write per second. The idea is to combine those tables into one and save some money. First, let's look at this neat ASCII diagram of what we have so far.\n\n\u003Cpre>\n\n +-----+ +-----+ +-----+     +-----+\n | id1 | | id3 | | id5 |     | idX |\n +-----+ +-----+ +-----+ ... +-----+\n | id2 | | id4 | | id6 |     | idY |\n +-----+ +-----+ +-----+     +-----+\n Table 1 Table 2 Table 3     Table N\n\n\u003C/pre>\n\nWe are going to create a new table called `shared` and also we'll have to create the global secondary index to that table which is treated like a separate table. We can do this through the console or by calling the AWS SDK.\n\n```java\nboolean createSharedTable(String sharedTableName, long readCapacity, long writeCapacity) {\n  if (existsTable(sharedTableName)) {\n    return false;\n  }\n  try {\n    // build the GSI request\n    GlobalSecondaryIndex secIndex = new GlobalSecondaryIndex().\n        withIndexName(sharedTableName + \"-index\").\n        withProvisionedThroughput(new ProvisionedThroughput().\n            withReadCapacityUnits(1L).\n            withWriteCapacityUnits(1L)).\n        withProjection(new Projection().withProjectionType(ProjectionType.ALL)).\n        withKeySchema(new KeySchemaElement().withAttributeName(\"tableID\").withKeyType(KeyType.HASH),\n            new KeySchemaElement().withAttributeName(\"timestamp\").withKeyType(KeyType.RANGE));\n\n    // create the shared table with the above GSI attached\n    getClient().createTable(new CreateTableRequest().withTableName(sharedTableName).\n        withKeySchema(new KeySchemaElement(Config._KEY, KeyType.HASH)).\n        withAttributeDefinitions(new AttributeDefinition(Config._KEY, ScalarAttributeType.S),\n            new AttributeDefinition(\"tableID\", ScalarAttributeType.S),\n            new AttributeDefinition(\"timestamp\", ScalarAttributeType.S)).\n        withGlobalSecondaryIndexes(secIndex).\n        withProvisionedThroughput(new ProvisionedThroughput(readCapacity, writeCapacity)));\n  } catch (Exception e) {\n    logger.error(\"Failed to create shared table.\", e);\n    return false;\n  }\n  return true;\n}\n```\n\nFirst we make a GSI request object by specifying its throughput — 1 read/1 write is sufficient as a starting point. This setting is determined by the number of queries (per second) to the database. Then we specify the attributes which will be copied over to the secondary index (all in this case). This allows us to retrieve the data from the index directly instead of getting just the `id` from the index then reading the actual object from the `shared` table as a second request. Finally, and most importantly, we need to set the attributes on which the index is defined — these will be `tableID` and `timestamp`. Going back to the first diagram, each table name will correspond to a `tableID` in the `shared` table. This will be the attribute which splits up the big table into smaller subtables (i.e. views). The `timestamp` field is used for sorting and is the so called \"range\" component of our index.\n\nThe result of the above request is going to be the table `shared` and the index `shared-index`.\n\n\u003Cpre>\n\n  WRITE TO +          READ FROM ^\n           |                    |\n  +--------v---+      +---------+--+\n  | table1_id1 |      | table1_id1 |\n  +------------+      +------------+\n  | table2_id3 |      | table1_id2 |\n  +------------+      +------------+\n  | table3_id5 |      | table2_id3 |\n  +------------+      +------------+\n  | table1_id2 |      | table2_id4 |\n  +------------+      +------------+\n  | table2_id4 +------+ table3_id5 |\n  +------------+      +------------+\n  | table3_id6 |      | table3_id6 |\n  +------------+      +------------+\n  |   . . .    |      |   . . .    |\n  +------------+      +------------+\n  | tableN_idX |      | tableN_idX |\n  +------------+      +------------+\n  | tableN_idY |      | tableN_idY |\n  +------------+      +------------+\n      shared           shared-index\n\n\u003C/pre>\n\nThe next important decision will be the format of the primary key in the `shared` table. We've decided to go for `tableID_objectID` — each object key is prefixed by the name of the table it belongs to. It's a simple and effective way to avoid key collisions and make sure that a request coming from \"table1\" cannot read the objects in \"table2\", for example.\n\nNow, we have to modify our code to be able to make requests to the new shared table and to do that we wrote a simple \"routing\" function which gives us the correct key to an object in a shared table:\n\n```java\nString getKeyForTableID(String key, String tableID) {\n  // if table is shared return the composite key\n  if (isSharedTable(tableID)) {\n    return tableID + \"_\" + key;\n  } else {\n    return key;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nSo, if we had a read function in our code called `readObject(key, table)` this will have to be changed to `readObject(getKeyForTableID(key, table))`. Thus we can not only read from standard tables but also we can read object from our `shared` table. Finally, if we want to query multiple objects (pages of objects) from `shared` we do a scan operation on the global index instead of the original table.\n\n```java\nString readPageFromSharedTable(String tableID, String fromKey, List\u003CPage\u003CItem, QueryOutcome>> results) {\n  ValueMap valueMap = new ValueMap().withString(\":tid\", tableID);\n  valueMap.put(\":ts\", fromKey);\n  Index index = getSharedIndex(tableID);\n\n  QuerySpec spec = new QuerySpec().withMaxPageSize(100).withMaxResultSize(100).\n      withKeyConditionExpression(\"tableID = :tid and timestamp > :ts\").\n      withValueMap(valueMap);\n\n  Page\u003CItem, QueryOutcome> items = index.query(spec);\n\n  if (items.hasNextPage()) {\n    results.add(items.firstPage());\n    // return last key as a start key to next page\n    return items.getLowLevelResult().getQueryResult().getLastEvaluatedKey().get(\"timestamp\").getS();\n  } else {\n    return null;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAlright, we have combined several tables into one, but how is that going to affect our AWS bill at the end of the month? Let's do some simple calculations. At the time of writing, a table with 1/1 throughput costs **$0.66/month**. This is the minimum cost of a table per month. If we had 100 small tables in the beginning, we'd have to pay **(100 * 0.66) = $66 per month**. That's a lot, especially if our tables were underutilized. The shared table with a global secondary index would cost a mere **$1.32/month** for the minimum capacity of 1 read/s and 1 write/s. That's a *50x* cost reduction — good job!\n\n*If you liked this post, you should check out [Para](https://paraio.com) - our backend service for busy developers.

Let’s do some simple calculations. At the time of writing, a table with 1/1 throughput costs \u003Cstrong>$0.66/month\u003C/strong>. This is the minimum cost of a table per month. If we had 100 small tables in the beginning, we’d have to pay \u003Cstrong>(100 * 0.66) = $66 per month\u003C/strong>. That’s a lot, especially if our tables were underutilized. The shared table with a global secondary index would cost a mere \u003Cstrong>$1.32/month\u003C/strong> for the minimum capacity of 1 read/s and 1 write/s.

Static sites are perfect for content which rarely changes. They lack dynamic features, but the main problem\nis that you can’t search quickly for a piece of content without leaving the site, which hinders the user experience.\n\nWe generate our blog using Hexo, a simple static site generator, and we’re quite happy with it. We’ve always felt that\nour search box could be improved and sending users off to Google was just sloppy. In this tutorial, I’ll show you how\nyou can also upgrade the search box on your blog or static site.\n\n\u003C!-- more -->\n\n![](/src/images/blogpost_media8.png)\n\nSo we have a bunch of HTML files generated for our site and we need them indexed somewhere so we can query them later.\nThe search box will send AJAX requests to the search API and presents the results to the user — very simple setup.\nSo we’ll need three things:\n\n1. a tool for quickly indexing our content;\n2. a full-text search API, preferably one that is free;\n3. some JavaScript code to call the API and show the results.\n\nCurrently, there are several solutions for implementing full-text search. Depending on the time and money you are\nwilling to spend, you could either host your own search server, like Elasticsearch or Solr, or pay for a service like\nAlgolia. Now, for something as simple as a blog with ten articles in it, paying for servers or a monthly subscription\nfee is a bit excessive. This is where [Para](https://paraio.com) comes in — our flexible, open-source backend service.\nIt’s absolutely free for developers and the search functionality inside of it is **powered by Elasticsearch** — *sweet!*\n\nInitially, when we started with this task we didn’t have the tool for indexing our blog posts and this lead to us\nwriting [para-cli](https://github.com/Erudika/para-cli) — a command-line tool for working with our Para backend server.\nIt’s written in JavaScript for Node.js and it’s really simple to use. Let’s go ahead and install it:\n\n```\n$ npm install -g para-cli\n# run setup and set endpoint to either 'http://localhost:8080' or 'https://paraio.com'\n$ para-cli setup\n```\n\nNow you can see all the options by typing `para-cli` in the console. There are several basic commands for reading,\nwriting and deleting objects and one for search. For now, we’re only interested in the `create` command.\n\nGo over to [ParaIO.com](https://paraio.com/signin) and sign in to get a free account, if you don’t have one already.\nNext, we’ll create a new app where we can store our blog posts. If you already have an existing app with some objects\nin it, you can still fit in the content of your site by using objects of a different type, like `blogpost`.\n\n![](/src/images/ftsearch1.png)\n\nTake a note of your Para access and secret keys, we’ll need them for our CLI tool. Now it’s time to gather our HTML\nfiles and send them to Para for indexing.\n\n```\n$ para-cli create \"blog/20*/**/*.html\" --type \"blogpost\" --sanitize \\\n--accessKey \"app:myapp\" --secretKey \"[key]\"\n```\n![](/src/images/ftsearch2.png)\n\nIn our case, HTML files are located in a folder called ‘blog’ with subfolders for each year. The CLI tool will parse\nevery HTML file and look for the these two tags:\n\n```html\n\u003Cmeta property=\"og:title\" content=\"…\">\n\u003Cmeta property=\"og:url\" content=\"…\">\n```\nMost static site generators, like Octopress and Hexo, automatically include these tags in the code. We’ll also want\nto index newly published blog posts, so we can simply execute the command above again and everything will be in sync.\nIf all went well, we should now have all our content indexed and ready. Let’s test it by sending a search query:\n\n```\n$ para-cli search \"some keyword\" --accessKey \"app:myapp\" --secretKey \"[key]\"\n```\nThis should return the results in as an array of JSON objects. Awesome! Now, in order for our client-side JavaScript\nwidget to be able to be able to access the Para search API without a secret key, we’ll have to allow public access to\nthe `blogposts` resource.\n\n![](/src/images/ftsearch3.png)\n\nThe search box in our case is implemented with good old jQuery and a plugin called\n[typehead.js](https://twitter.github.io/typeahead.js/). The code is very simple — it calls the search API and queries\nobjects of type `blogpost`. The results are in the form of a JSON object with several properties but we’re only\ninterested in the objects found so we transform it into an `Array`.\n\n```js\nvar APPID = \"app:myapp\";\nvar ENDPOINT = \"https://paraio.com/v1\";\n\n$.ajaxSetup({\n  headers: {'Authorization': 'Anonymous ' + APPID}\n});\n\nvar blogposts = new Bloodhound({\n  datumTokenizer: Bloodhound.tokenizers.whitespace,\n  queryTokenizer: Bloodhound.tokenizers.whitespace,\n  remote: {\n    url: ENDPOINT + '/blogposts?q=%QUERY',\n    wildcard: '%QUERY',\n    transform: function (res) {\n      return res.items || [];\n    }\n  }\n});\n\n$('#search-box').typeahead({\n  hint: false,\n  highlight: true,\n  minLength: 3\n},\n{\n  name: 'blogposts',\n  source: blogposts,\n  templates: {\n    notFound: '\u003Ci>No results.\u003C/i>'\n  },\n  display: function (result) {\n    return result.name;\n  }\n});\n\n$('#search-box').bind('typeahead:select', function (ev, result) {\n  window.location = result.url || '';\n});\n```\n\nFinally we add some CSS styling to make our widget look good. Some of these classes are typehead.js specific but can\nalso be modified.\n\n```css\n#search-box {\n  background: #fff;\n  width: 100%;\n  padding: 10px;\n  border-radius: 3px;\n  border: 1px solid #ddd;\n  font-size: 1.4em;\n}\n.tt-menu {\n  width: 100%;\n  margin: 2px 0;\n  padding: 5px 10px;\n  background-color: #fff;\n  border: 1px solid #ccc;\n}\n.tt-suggestion:last-child {\n  border-bottom: none;\n}\n.tt-suggestion {\n  border-bottom: 1px dashed #ccc;\n  font-size: 1.4em;\n  padding: 10px 0;\n}\n.tt-suggestion.tt-cursor {\n  color: #fff;\n  background-color: #0097cf;\n}\n.twitter-typeahead {\n  width: 100%;\n}\n```\n\n## Final result\n\n*That’s it!* You can try out the finished thing at the top of this page, above the title.\nWe chose jQuery just because it was already included in our HTML code but you can just as easily achieve the same\nresult with other JS frameworks like Angular or React.\n\n*If you liked this post, you can also follow us [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/erudika) or chat with us\n[on Gitter](https://gitter.im/Erudika/para).*","src/content/blog/Implementing-full-text-search-for-your-static-site.md","c4b72348dce2ff89",{"html":253,"metadata":254},"\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Static site generators are great\u003C/strong> — they get the job done quickly for our blogs, landing pages and project websites.\nThey make it easy to build something, deploy it and forget it — free hosting, nothing to maintain, a sort of “serverless”\ntechnology.

This is where \u003Ca href=\"https://paraio.com\">Para\u003C/a> comes in — our flexible, open-source backend service.\nIt’s absolutely free for developers and the search functionality inside of it is \u003Cstrong>powered by Elasticsearch\u003C/strong> — \u003Cem>sweet!\u003C/em>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Initially, when we started with this task we didn’t have the tool for indexing our blog posts and this lead to us\nwriting \u003Ca href=\"https://github.com/Erudika/para-cli\">para-cli\u003C/a> — a command-line tool for working with our Para backend server.\nIt’s written in JavaScript for Node.js and it’s really simple to use.

for Angular](/blog/building-the-stack-from-scratch-with-angular-2).\n\nIn this tutorial we're going to build a simple single-page application with **React** (v16 and above). This is intended\nfor developers unfamiliar with the new framework or having some experience with React. First of all, I got\n**Visual Studio Code** installed on my machine and it's running on Linux. I chose VS Code because we'll be working with\n**JavaScript** and **JSX** and it has great support for those, but you can code in your favourite IDE as well.\nThe code project for this article was generated with `create-react-app`, a scaffolding tool for React. \nYou'll also need to have **Git**, **Node.js** and **npm** installed.\n\n\u003C!-- more -->\n\n![](/src/images/blogpost_media14.png)\n\n## Step 0 (frontend)\n\n- Get [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)\n- Get [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)\n- Get [Node.js with npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)\n- Generate a project with ['create-react-app'](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started) with `npx create-react-app react-para --use-npm`\n- Open the project in the VS Code editor\n\n```bash\nnpx create-react-app react-para --use-npm \ncd react-para\n# watches your files and does live reload\nnpm start\n```\n\nNext - **the backend**. Here, I could write a simple backend in Node.js and Express but I'm lazy so I chose not to.\nInstead, I'm going to use **Para** for my backend and I'm not going to write *any* code on the server. If you are\nnew to Para, it's a general-purpose backend framework/server written in Java. It will save me a lot of time and effort\nbecause it has a nice JSON API for our app to connect to. To run the server you're going to need a Java runtime.\n\n## Step 0 (backend)\n\n- Get [Java](https://jdk.java.net/12/)\n- Get [Para](https://paraio.org/)\n- Start the server in a separate terminal:\n\n```bash\n# run Para\njava -jar para-x.y.z.jar\n```\n\nNow, check if Para is running - open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8080/v1`. You should see a response like\nthis:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"info\" : \"Para - a backend for busy developers.\",\n  \"version\" : \"x.y.z\"\n}\n```\nWe haven't got access keys to the server yet, so let's go ahead and do that, open:\n```\nhttp://localhost:8080/v1/_setup\n```\nSave the credentials to a file, we'll need them later to access the backend API.\n\n## Step 1 - API access\n\nLet's create an app for storing recipes - a recipe manager. Our goal will be to build just the basic CRUD functionality,\nwithout adding extra features like authentication and login pages. By default the backend is secured and only signed\nrequests are allowed, but for the purpose of this tutorial we're going to add a new permission to allow all requests to\njust one specific resource - `/v1/recipes`.\n\nGo to [console.paraio.org](https://console.paraio.org) and enter the credentials that you saved in the beginning. Also\nclick the cog icon to edit the API endpoint and set it to `http://localhost:8080`. Click 'Connect'.\n\nNext, go to 'App' on the left and edit the root app called `para`. You'll see a section for resource permissions and\nthere you will write a simple permission definition in JSON:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"*\": {\n    \"recipes\": [\"*\", \"?\"]\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis defines a single permission that allows `* - everyone` to access `/v1/recipes` using a list of allowed methods,\nin this case `* - all HTTP methods` and `? - anonymous access` is allowed. Thus, we're essentially making this resource\npublicly available. Click 'Save Changes'.\n\n![](/src/images/rman_1.png)\n\n## Step 2 - CRUD recipes\n\nLet's create a new frontend component called `Home.js`.\nNow let's edit the 'Home' component in `src/Home.js`:\n```js\nimport React from 'react';\n\nexport default class Home extends React.Component {\n\tconstructor(props) {\n        super(props);\n        this.state = {\n            q: '',\n            createMode: false,\n            recipesList: [],\n            editedRecipes: {}\n        };\n    }\n}\n```\n\nLet's implement the `render()` function:\n\n```js\nrender() {\n    return (\n        \u003Cdiv id=\"home\">\n            \u003Ch1>My Recipes &nbsp; \u003Cbutton onClick={() => this.newRecipeForm()}>Add\u003C/button>\u003C/h1>\n            \u003Cdiv>\n                \u003Cform onSubmit={this.search}>\n                \t\u003Clabel>Search\u003C/label>\n                    \u003Cinput type=\"text\" defaultValue=\"\" name=\"q\" placeholder=\"Search\" id=\"search\" />\n                \u003C/form>\n            \u003C/div>\n            {this.state.recipesList && this.state.recipesList.length === 0 ? \u003Cdiv className=\"empty-box\">No recipes to show.\u003C/div> : \"\"}\n            \u003Cul>{this.state.recipesList.map((recipe, index) => \u003Cthis.RecipeItem key={recipe.id || \"new\" } recipe={recipe} index={index} />)}\u003C/ul>\n        \u003C/div>\n    );\n}\n```\n\nThe `RecipeItem` element is implemented next:\n\n```js\nRecipeItem(props) {\n    let recipe = props.recipe;\n    let index = props.index;\n    return (\n        \u003Cli className=\"recipe-box\">\n            \u003Cdiv className={(this.state.editedRecipes[recipe.id] || (!recipe.id && this.state.createMode)) ? \"hide\" : \"\"}>\n                \u003Ch3>{recipe.name}\u003C/h3>\n                \u003Chr />\n                \u003Cdiv>{this.renderMD(recipe.text)}\u003C/div>\n                \u003Cbr />\n                \u003Cbutton onClick={(e) => this.editRecipe(recipe)}>edit\u003C/button> &nbsp;\n            \u003Ca href=\"/\" onClick={(e) => { this.removeRecipe(recipe.id); e.preventDefault() }} className=\"red right\">remove\u003C/a>\n            \u003C/div>\n            \u003Cdiv>\n                \u003Cform onSubmit={(e) => { this.addRecipe(recipe); e.preventDefault() }} className={((recipe.id || !this.state.createMode) && !this.state.editedRecipes[recipe.id]) ? \"hide\" : \"\"}>\n                    \u003Cdiv>\n                        \u003Cinput type=\"text\" value={recipe.name} onChange={(e) => this.handleInputChange(e, recipe, index)} placeholder=\"Title\" name=\"name\" />\n                    \u003C/div>\n                    \u003Cbr />\n                    \u003Cdiv>\n                        \u003Ctextarea value={recipe.text} onChange={(e) => this.handleInputChange(e, recipe, index)} rows=\"10\" cols=\"33\" placeholder=\"Recipe\" name=\"text\">\u003C/textarea>\n                    \u003C/div>\n                    \u003Cbutton type=\"submit\">\n                        \u003Cspan>{this.state.createMode ? \"Add\" : \"Save\"}\u003C/span>\n                    \u003C/button>\n                    &nbsp;\n                \u003Ca href=\"/\" onClick={(e) => { this.closeForm(recipe.id); e.preventDefault() }}>Close\u003C/a>\n                \u003C/form>\n            \u003C/div>\n        \u003C/li>\n    );\n}\n```\n\nI've added the \"Add\" button which shows the form where we can write a recipe (controlled by `newRecipeForm()`), a textarea,\nand a close button. Notice how the text value of the \"Add\" button changes to \"Save\" when we're in edit mode.\n\nLet's create the toolbar and navbar components in `src/App.js`. We'll also install `react-router` because we want to have\n2 pages - `/` Home, and `/about`.\n```\nnpm install --save react-router-dom\n```\nHere's the code for `App.js`:\n```js\nimport React from 'react';\nimport { BrowserRouter, Route, NavLink } from \"react-router-dom\";\nimport pkg from '../package.json';\nimport About from './About';\nimport Home from './Home';\n\nfunction App() {\n    return (\n        \u003Cdiv>\n            \u003Cdiv className=\"App\">\n                \u003Cheader className=\"App-header\">\n                    \u003Ch1>Recipe Manager \u003Ccode>\u003Csmall>v{pkg.version}\u003C/small>\u003C/code>\u003C/h1>\n                    \u003Cdiv className=\"more\">\u003C/div>\n                \u003C/header>\n            \u003C/div>\n            \u003Cdiv>\n                \u003CBrowserRouter basename={process.env.NODE_ENV === \"production\" ? \"/react-para\" : \"/\"}>\n                    \u003Cnav>\n                        \u003CNavLink to=\"/\" exact activeClassName=\"router-link-active\" >Home\u003C/NavLink>\n                        \u003CNavLink to=\"/about\" activeClassName=\"router-link-active\">About\u003C/NavLink>\n                    \u003C/nav>\n                    \u003CRoute path=\"/\" exact component={Home} />\n                    \u003CRoute path=\"/about\" exact component={About} />\n                \u003C/BrowserRouter>\n            \u003C/div>\n        \u003C/div>\n    );\n}\n\nexport default App;\n```\n\nLet's create a new service to talk to our Para backend and fetch recipes. Let's call it `RecipesService`. \nImport the file by adding the following line to the top of `src/Home.js`:\n```js\nimport RecipeService from './RecipeService';\n```\n\nThe service file should be located in `src/RecipeService.js`. We'll modify the file `src/RecipeService.js` and\nadd a basic get method. Let's also add the code for making the `POST` request to the backend for creating recipes:\n\n```js\nexport default class RecipeService {\n    static appID = process.env.PARA_APP_ID || \"app:myapp\";\n    static appSecret = process.env.PARA_SECRET || \"\"; // unused\n    static RECIPES_RESOURCE = (process.env.PARA_ENDPOINT || \"https://paraio.com\") + \"/v1/recipes\";\n\n    static headers = {\n        'Content-Type': 'application/json',\n        'Authorization': 'Anonymous ' + RecipeService.appID\n    };\n\n    static get() {\n        return fetch(RecipeService.RECIPES_RESOURCE, { headers: RecipeService.headers})\n    }\n\n    static add(name, text) {\n      if (!name || !text) { return Promise.reject(); }\n      const recipe = { name, text };\n      return fetch(RecipeService.RECIPES_RESOURCE, { headers: RecipeService.headers,\n        body: JSON.stringify(recipe), method: 'POST'});\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe `process.env.PARA_APP_ID` is an environment variable which you can override. The same is true for all the other env\nvariables in the code above. Note that in a production build `process.env.NODE_ENV` always equals `production`, otherwise\nit has a value of `development`.\n\nNow we're going to focus on that `addRecipe()` method so let's implement it:\n\n```js\naddRecipe(recipe) {\n    if (recipe && recipe.id) {\n        RecipeService.edit(recipe.id, recipe.name, recipe.text);\n    } else {\n        let recipes = this.state.recipesList.slice(0);\n        RecipeService.add(recipe.name, recipe.text).then(data => {\n            if (data) {\n                data.json().then(d => {\n                    if (this.state.createMode) {\n                        const first = recipes.shift();\n                        recipes.unshift(d);\n                        recipes.unshift(first);\n                    } else {\n                        recipes.unshift(d);\n                    }\n                    this.setState({ recipesList: recipes });\n                });\n            }\n        });\n    }\n    this.closeForm(recipe.id);\n}\n```\n\nIn the file `Home.js` we have a list of recipes `recipesList` which is an `Array` and it's part of our local state object.\nWe also have `this.state.editedRecipes: {}` which keeps track of which recipe object is being edited.\n\nLet's also add the method for listing recipes `listRecipes()` and call it upon initialization. For this we also need to \nadd another method called `componentDidMount()`:\n\n```js\ncomponentDidMount() {\n    let recipes = this.listRecipes();\n    let edited = {};\n    recipes.then(recipes => {\n        recipes.forEach((recipe, index) => {\n            edited[recipe.id] = false;\n        });\n    }).finally(() => {\n        this.setState({editedRecipes:  Object.assign(this.state.editedRecipes, edited)});\n    });\n}\n\nasync listRecipes() {\n    const data = await RecipeService.get();\n    const d = await data.json();\n    this.setState({ recipesList: d.items });\n    return d.items;\n}\n```\n\nThe `listRecipes()` method is marked `async` and it calls the backend API for a list of objects of type `recipe`.\nWhen that's done, we finally update the state and populate the `recipeList` array.\n\nIn `src/Home.js` we loop over the `recipesList` of all available recipes, and also a box which appears\nwhen there are no recipes to show:\n```html\n\u003Cul>{this.state.recipesList.map((recipe, index) => \u003Cthis.RecipeItem key={recipe.id || \"new\" } recipe={recipe} index={index} />)}\u003C/ul>\n```\n\nLet's add the styling for `.recipe-box` and `.empty-box` in `src/index.css` (the main CSS file):\n\n```css\n.recipe-box {\n  display: inline-table;\n  width: 300px;\n  margin: 30px 30px 0 -7px;\n  padding: 20px;\n  border: 1px solid #106cc8;\n}\n.empty-box {\n  height: 200px;\n  width: 100%;\n  padding: 1.5em 0 1em 0;\n  font-size: 3em;\n  color: #ccc;\n  border: 3px dashed;\n  text-align: center;\n}\n```\nIn `src/index.css` I've also added a few more tweaks to the CSS:\n```css\ninput, textarea {\n  border: 1px solid #106cc8;\n  font-size: 14px;\n  height: 40px;\n  outline: none;\n  padding: 8px;\n}\nbutton {\n  background-color: #106cc8;\n  border-style: none;\n  color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.87);\n  cursor: pointer;\n  display: inline-block;\n  font-size: 14px;\n  height: 40px;\n  padding: 8px 18px;\n  text-decoration: none;\n}\nbutton:hover { background-color: #28739e; }\nbutton.small { font-size: 12px; height: 30px; }\n.red { color: indianred; }\n.right { float: right; }\n.center { text-align: center; }\n.hide { display: none; }\n```\n\n![](/src/images/rman_2.png)\n\nSo, we should now we able to add recipes and after we click \"Add\" the form should be cleared and closed.\nFor this let's add a couple of methods in `Home.js` - one to initialize the form and one to reset the\nstate of the form:\n```js\nnewRecipeForm() {\n    if (!this.state.createMode) {\n        this.state.recipesList.unshift({ name: '', text: '' });\n        this.setState({ createMode: true });\n    }\n}\n\ncloseForm(recipeId) {\n    if (recipeId) {\n        let props = this.state.editedRecipes;\n        props[recipeId] = false;\n        this.setState({ editedRecipes: props });\n    }\n}\n```\n\n![](/src/images/rman_3.png)\n\nThe variable `recipeId` will keep the value of the `id` when a recipe is being edited. When \"Save\" is clicked this\n`id` is passed to the service and the backend so it won't create a new object, just update an existing one.\nWe're issuing these requests and we don't care about the results because we can update the UI\ninstantly, without having to wait for the request to finish.\n\n```js\neditRecipe(recipe) {\n    let props = {};\n    props[recipe.id] = true;\n    this.setState({ editedRecipes: Object.assign(this.state.editedRecipes, props) });\n}\n\nremoveRecipe(id) {\n    RecipeService.remove(id).then(() => {\n        let recipes = this.state.recipesList.slice(0);\n        this.setState({ recipesList: recipes.filter((el) => el.id !== id) });\n    });\n}\n```\n\nLet's also add similar methods in our `RecipeService` for updating and deleting recipes. The methods `editRecipe()` and\n`removeRecipe()` are relatively straightforward - when editing, we switch to edit mode and we show the form, when\nremoving we just filter the array `recipesList` and we discard the deleted recipe if it matches the `id`.\n\n```js\nstatic edit(id, name, text) {\n  if (!id) { return Promise.reject(); }\n  const recipe = { name, text };\n  return fetch(RecipeService.RECIPES_RESOURCE + '/' + id, { headers: RecipeService.headers,\n    body: JSON.stringify(recipe), method: 'PATCH'});\n}\n\nstatic remove(id) {\n  if (!id) { return Promise.reject(); }\n  return fetch(RecipeService.RECIPES_RESOURCE + '/' + id, { headers: RecipeService.headers, method: 'DELETE'});\n}\n```\n\n![](/src/images/rman_4.png)\n\nWe can now add, edit and remove recipes but they aren't very pretty and the formatting of the text\nis lost. In the next step we'll make it possible to write the recipe text in Markdown and then render it in HTML.\n\n## Step 3 - Markdown support\n\nFirst of all, let's install `showdown` - a nice JavaScript parser for Markdown:\n```bash\nnpm install showdown --save\n```\nThen we import it in `Home.js`:\n```\nimport { Converter } from 'showdown';\n```\nFinally we'll implement a simple method called `md2html()` which will be used in our template.\n```js\nmd2html(text) {\n\treturn new Converter().makeHtml(text || '');\n}\nrenderMD(text) {\n    return { __html: this.md2html(text) };\n}\n```\nIn our render method in `Home.js` we'll replace `\u003Cdiv>{this.renderMD(recipe.text)}\u003C/div>` with the actual rendered Markdown:\n```html\n\u003Cdiv dangerouslySetInnerHTML={this.renderMD(recipe.text)} />\n```\nNow we render the text to HTML on the client and this allows us to write beautiful recipes like this:\n\n![](/src/images/rman_5.png)\n\n## Step 4 - Full-text search\n\nThe final feature left is the recipe search box. We'll use the built-in full-text search in Para. In `RecipeService.js` add:\n```js\nstatic search(q) {\n  return fetch(RecipeService.RECIPES_RESOURCE + '?q=' + q, { headers: RecipeService.headers});\n}\n```\nAnd in `Home.js` add:\n```js\nsearch(event) {\n    RecipeService.search(event.target.q.value || '*').then(data => {\n        data.json().then(d => {\n            if (d.items) {\n                this.setState({ recipesList: d.items });\n            }\n        });\n    });\n    event.preventDefault();\n}\n```\nFinally, we add the method for handling changes to the input text:\n\n```js\nhandleInputChange(event, recipe, index) {\n    let recipes = this.state.recipesList.slice(0);\n    recipe[event.target.name] = event.target.value;\n    recipes[index] = recipe;\n    this.setState({\n        recipesList: Object.assign(this.state.recipesList, recipes)\n    });\n}\n```\n\nAnd we're done! Here's final result of our **Recipe Manager**\n(check out [the live demo](https://albogdano.github.io/react-para/)):\n\n![](/src/images/rman_6.png)\n\n## Final touches\n\nYou can see the result in your browser by running `npm start`. Optionally, you can make this web application \"progressive\"\n(PWA) by editing `index.js` and adding `serviceWorker.register();`. This will create a `manifest.json` and make the\npage available offline. Our code now passes the Lighthouse audit with flying colors!\n\n![](/src/images/rman_7.png)\n\nAll that is left is to build the project for production and deploy it:\n```\nnpm run build\n# git push origin master\n```\n\n## Summary\n\nLearning React takes some time as it introduces a lot of new concepts and new syntax (JSX).\nWriting in JSX feels weird at first but you get used to it pretty quickly. The way `setState()` works also took me\na bit of time to understand. In general, the experience of writing React apps with the help\nof the new React CLI tool is great - the scaffolding just works, the build process is fast and painless,\nthe JSX syntax is somewhat clean (but not as clean as in Angular), the app is well structured and the error \nmessages are clear and understandable.\n\n**Things we did:**\n\n- generated a new project from scratch with React CLI\n- wrote a few fancy AJAX calls to our backend API using `fetch`\n- wired a bunch of simple JS code between a component and a service\n- wrote some good old HTML and CSS\n- imported an external library with npm an typings\n\n**Things we didn't do:**\n\n- didn't write *any* backend code for CRUD operations on recipes\n- didn't define a schema for the \"recipe\" type on the server side\n\nThe complete code for this tutorial is on GitHub at [albogdano/react-para](https://github.com/albogdano/react-para).\nI've deployed the same code to GitHub pages as a [live demo](https://albogdano.github.io/react-para/) which\nis powered by our [cloud-based Para service](https://paraio.com).\n\n *Have questions or suggestions?

The same article is also [available for React](/blog/building-a-full-stack-application-from-scratch-with-react/).\n\nIn this tutorial we're going to build a simple single-page application with **Angular** (v8 and above). This is intended\nfor developers unfamiliar with the new framework or having some experience with AngularJS. First of all, I got\n**Visual Studio Code** installed on my machine and it's running on Linux. I chose VS Code because we'll be working with\n**TypeScript** mostly and it has great support for it, but you can code in your favourite IDE as well.\nOriginally, the code in this article was based on the excellent Angular 2 Seed project by [Minko Gechev](https://github.com/mgechev)\nThat project is now deprecated in favor of Angular CLI and the code here has been migrated to use the new official build\ntool for Angular. You'll also need to have **Git**, **Node.js** and **npm** installed.\n\n\u003C!-- more -->\n\n![](/src/images/blogpost_media5.png)\n\n## Step 0 (frontend)\n\n- Get [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)\n- Get [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)\n- Get [Node.js with npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)\n- Install ['Angular CLI'](https://cli.angular.io/) with `npm install -g @angular/cli`\n- Open the project in the VS Code editor\n\n```bash\nnpm install -g @angular/cli\nng new angular-para\ncd angular-para\n# install the project's dependencies\nnpm install\n# watches your files and does live reload\nng serve\n```\n\nNext - **the backend**. Here, I could write a simple backend in Node.js and Express but I'm lazy so I chose not to.\nInstead, I'm going to use **Para** for my backend and I'm not going to write *any* code on the server. If you are\nnew to Para, it's a general-purpose backend framework/server written in Java. It will save me a lot of time and effort\nbecause it has a nice JSON API for our app to connect to. To run the server you're going to need a Java runtime.\n\n## Step 0 (backend)\n\n- Get [Java](https://jdk.java.net/12/)\n- Get [Para](https://paraio.org/)\n- Start the server in a separate terminal:\n\n```bash\n# run Para\njava -jar para-x.y.z.jar\n```\n\nNow, check if Para is running - open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8080/v1`. You should see a response like\nthis:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"info\" : \"Para - a backend for busy developers.\",\n  \"version\" : \"x.y.z\"\n}\n```\nWe haven't got access keys to the server yet, so let's go ahead and do that, open:\n```\nhttp://localhost:8080/v1/_setup\n```\nSave the credentials to a file, we'll need them later to access the backend API.\n\n## Step 1 - API access\n\nLet's create an app for storing recipes - a recipe manager. Our goal will be to build just the basic CRUD functionality,\nwithout adding extra features like authentication and login pages. By default the backend is secured and only signed\nrequests are allowed, but for the purpose of this tutorial we're going to add a new permission to allow all requests to\njust one specific resource - `/v1/recipes`.\n\nGo to [console.paraio.org](https://console.paraio.org) and enter the credentials that you saved in the beginning. Also\nclick the cog icon to edit the API endpoint and set it to `http://localhost:8080`. Click 'Connect'.\n\nNext, go to 'App' on the left and edit the root app called `para`. You'll see a section for resource permissions and\nthere you will write a simple permission definition in JSON:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"*\": {\n    \"recipes\": [\"*\", \"?\"]\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis defines a single permission that allows `* - everyone` to access `/v1/recipes` using a list of allowed methods,\nin this case `* - all HTTP methods` and `? - anonymous access` is allowed. Thus, we're essentially making this resource\npublicly available. Click 'Save Changes'.\n\n![](/src/images/rman_1.png)\n\n## Step 2 - CRUD recipes\n\nLet's create a new frontend component called \"home\" with the command `ng generate component home`.\nNow let's edit the 'home' component under `src/app/home`. In particular, we want to edit the HTML code in `home.component.html`:\n\n```html\n\u003Ch1>My Recipes &nbsp; \u003Cbutton (click)=\"newRecipeForm()\">Add\u003C/button>\u003C/h1>\n\u003Cdiv>\n  \u003Cform (submit)=\"search()\">\n    \u003Cinput type=\"text\" [(ngModel)]=\"q\" name=\"searchText\" placeholder=\"Search\">\n  \u003C/form>\n\u003C/div>\n\u003Cul>\n\t\u003C!-- TODO: add box showing \"no recipes found\" -->\n  \u003Cli *ngFor=\"let recipe of recipesList; let i = index\" class=\"recipe-box\">\n    \u003Cdiv [hidden]=\"editedRecipes.get(recipe.id) || (!recipe.id && createMode)\">\n      \u003Ch3>{{recipe.name}}\u003C/h3>\n      \u003Chr>\n      \u003Cdiv [innerHTML]=\"md2html(recipe.text)\">\u003C/div>\n      \u003Cbr>\n      \u003Cbutton href=\"#\" (click)=\"editRecipe(recipe)\">edit\u003C/button> &nbsp;\n      \u003Ca href=\"#\" (click)=\"removeRecipe(recipe.id)\" class=\"red right\">remove\u003C/a>\n    \u003C/div>\n    \u003Cdiv [hidden]=\"(recipe.id || !createMode) && !editedRecipes.get(recipe.id)\">\n      \u003Cform (submit)=\"addRecipe(recipe)\">\n        \u003Cdiv>\n          \u003Cinput [(ngModel)]=\"recipe.name\" placeholder=\"Title\" [name]=\"'name' + i\">\n        \u003C/div>\n        \u003Cbr>\n        \u003Cdiv>\n          \u003Ctextarea [(ngModel)]=\"recipe.text\" rows=\"10\" cols=\"33\" placeholder=\"Recipe\" [name]=\"'text' + i\">\u003C/textarea>\n        \u003C/div>\n        \u003Cbutton type=\"submit\">\n          \u003Cspan *ngIf=\"createMode\">Add\u003C/span>\n          \u003Cspan *ngIf=\"!createMode\">Save\u003C/span>\n        \u003C/button>\n        &nbsp;\n        \u003Ca href=\"#\" (click)=\"closeForm(recipe.id)\">Close\u003C/a>\n      \u003C/form>\n    \u003C/div>\n  \u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>\n```\n\nI've added the \"Add\" button which shows the form where we can write a recipe (controlled by `newRecipeForm()`), a textarea,\nand a close button. Notice how the text value of the \"Add\" button changes to \"Save\" when we're in edit mode. Coming\nfrom AngularJS, you'll notice the weird `[(ngModel)]` syntax - it's a two-way binding (single brackets is one-way).\nSimilarly, `*ngIf` is just shorthand for `[ngIf]`.\n\nLet's create a new \"core\" module and 2 new components inside it - the \"toolbar\" and \"navbar\".\n```\nng generate module core\nng generate component core/toolbar\nng generate component core/navbar\n```\n\nAlso, I chose to set a new title in the header section in `src/app/core/toolbar/toolbar.component.html`:\n```html\n\u003Ch1>Recipe Manager \u003Ccode>\u003Csmall>v{{version}}\u003C/small>\u003C/code>\u003C/h1>\n\u003Cdiv class=\"more\">\u003C/div>\n```\n\nLet's create a new service to talk to our Para backend and fetch recipes. Let's call it `RecipesService`.\n```\nng generate service recipe\n```\nThe service file should be located in `src/app/recipe.service.ts`. We'll modify the file `recipe.service.ts` to allow for\nanother parameter `text` in the `add()` method. Let's also add the code for making the `POST` request to the backend:\n\n```ts\nimport { environment as Config } from 'src/environments/environment';\n\n@Injectable()\nexport class RecipeService {\n\tprivate appID = 'app:myapp';\n\tprivate RECIPES_RESOURCE = Config.API + '/v1/recipes';\n\n\tadd(name: string, text: string) {\n\t\tif (!name || !text) { return of(null); }\n\t\tconst recipe: any = { name: name, text: text };\n\t\treturn this.http.post(this.RECIPES_RESOURCE, JSON.stringify(recipe), this.options);\n\t}\n}\n```\nThe `Config` object is actually imported from `src/environments/environment.ts` where we have a JS object containing all\nthe configuration properties for our project. That file replaced with `environment.prod.ts` when we compile the project\nfor production use.\n\nIn the code for `home.component.ts` we'll add a few fields to manage the recipes. The start of that component should look\nlike this:\n\n```ts\n@Component({\n  selector: 'app-home',\n  templateUrl: 'home.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['home.component.css'],\n})\nexport class HomeComponent implements OnInit {\n  recipesList: Array\u003Cany>;\n  createMode = false;\n  q: string;\n  editedRecipes: Map\u003Cstring, boolean>;\n\n  constructor(public recipeService: RecipeService) {\n    this.editedRecipes = new Map\u003Cstring, boolean>();\n    this.recipesList = new Array();\n  }\n\n  addRecipe(): boolean { }\n}\n```\n\nNow we're going to focus on that `addRecipe()` method so let's implement it:\n\n```ts\naddRecipe(recipe: any) {\n\tthis.recipeService.add(recipe.name, recipe.text)\n\t\t.subscribe((data: any) => {\n\t\t\tif (data) {\n\t\t\t\tif (this.createMode) {\n\t\t\t\t\tconst first = this.recipesList.shift();\n\t\t\t\t\tthis.recipesList.unshift(data);\n\t\t\t\t\tthis.recipesList.unshift(first);\n\t\t\t\t} else {\n\t\t\t\t\tthis.recipesList.unshift(data);\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t});\n\tthis.closeForm(recipe.id);\n}\n```\nLet's also add the method for listing recipes `listRecipes()` and call it upon initialization:\n\n```ts\nngOnInit() {\n\tthis.listRecipes();\n}\n\nlistRecipes() {\n\tthis.recipeService.get()\n\t\t.subscribe((data: any) => {\n\t\t\tthis.recipesList = data.items;\n\t\t});\n}\n```\n\nYou'll notice that in `home.component.ts`, we subscribe to the `Observable` returned by\n`recipeService.add()` and get back the list of recipes when they arrive.\n```ts\nthis.recipeService.add(this.newName, this.newRecipe).subscribe((data: any) => {\n    // response might be null or empty\n    if (data) {\n        this.recipesList.unshift(data);\n    }\n});\n```\n\nIn `home.component.html` we loop over the `recipesList` of all available recipes, and also a box which appears\nwhen there are no recipes to show:\n```html\n\u003Cul>\n  \u003Cdiv class=\"empty-box\" *ngIf=\"recipesList && recipesList.length == 0\">\n    No recipes to show.\n  \u003C/div>\n  \u003Cli *ngFor=\"let recipe of recipesList\" class=\"recipe-box\">\n    ...\n  \u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>\n```\n\nLet's add the styling for `.recipe-box` and `.empty-box` later in `home.component.css`:\n\n```css\n.recipe-box {\n  display: inline-table;\n  width: 300px;\n  margin: 30px 30px 0 -7px;\n  padding: 20px;\n  border: 1px solid #106cc8;\n}\n.empty-box {\n  height: 200px;\n  width: 100%;\n  padding: 1.5em 0 1em 0;\n  font-size: 3em;\n  color: #ccc;\n  border: 3px dashed;\n  text-align: center;\n}\n```\nIn `src/styles.css` I've also added a few more tweaks to the CSS:\n```css\ninput, textarea {\n  border: 1px solid #106cc8;\n  font-size: 14px;\n  height: 40px;\n  outline: none;\n  padding: 8px;\n}\nbutton {\n  background-color: #106cc8;\n  border-style: none;\n  color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.87);\n  cursor: pointer;\n  display: inline-block;\n  font-size: 14px;\n  height: 40px;\n  padding: 8px 18px;\n  text-decoration: none;\n}\nbutton:hover { background-color: #28739e; }\nbutton.small { font-size: 12px; height: 30px; }\n.red { color: indianred; }\n.right { float: right; }\n.center { text-align: center; }\n```\n\n![](/src/images/rman_2.png)\n\nSo, we should now we able to add recipes and after we click \"Add\" the form should be cleared and closed.\nFor this let's add a couple of methods in `home.component.ts` - one to initialize the form and one to reset the\nstate of the form:\n```ts\nnewRecipeForm() {\n\tif (!this.createMode) {\n\t\tthis.recipesList.unshift({name: '', text: ''});\n\t\tthis.createMode = true;\n\t}\n}\n\ncloseForm(recipeId: string) {\n\tif (recipeId) {\n\t\tthis.editedRecipes.set(recipeId, false);\n\t} else if (this.createMode) {\n\t\tthis.recipesList.shift();\n\t\tthis.createMode = false;\n\t}\n}\n```\n\n![](/src/images/rman_3.png)\n\nThe variable `recipeId` will keep the value of the `id` when a recipe is being edited. When \"Save\" is clicked this\n`id` is passed to the service and the backend so it won't create a new object, just update an existing one.\nWe're issuing these requests and we don't care about the results because we can update the UI\ninstantly, without having to wait for the request to finish.\n\n```ts\neditRecipe(recipe: any) {\n\tthis.editedRecipes.set(recipe.id, true);\n}\n\nremoveRecipe(id: string) {\n\tthis.recipeService.remove(id).subscribe();\n\tthis.recipesList = this.recipesList.filter((el) => el.id !== id);\n}\n```\n\nLet's also add similar methods in our `RecipeService` for updating and deleting recipes. The methods `editRecipe()` and\n`removeRecipe()` are relatively straightforward - when editing, we switch to edit mode and we show the form, when\nremoving we just filter the array `recipesList` and we discard the deleted recipe if it matches the `id`.\n\n```ts\nedit(id: string, name: string, text: string) {\n\tif (!id) { return of(null); }\n\tconst recipe: any = { name: name, text: text };\n\treturn this.http.patch(this.RECIPES_RESOURCE + '/' + id, JSON.stringify(recipe), this.options);\n}\n\nremove(id: string) {\n\tif (!id) { return of(null); }\n\treturn this.http.delete(this.RECIPES_RESOURCE + '/' + id, this.options);\n}\n```\n\nIn `home.component.ts` we'll modify the code for `addRecipe()` to also edit a recipe when `recipe.id` is set.\n```ts\naddRecipe(recipe: any) {\n\tif (recipe && recipe.id) {\n\t\tthis.recipeService.edit(recipe.id, recipe.name, recipe.text).subscribe();\n\t} else {\n\t\tthis.recipeService.add(recipe.name, recipe.text)\n\t\t\t.subscribe((data: any) => {\n\t\t\t\tif (data) {\n\t\t\t\t\tif (this.createMode) {\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconst first = this.recipesList.shift();\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthis.recipesList.unshift(data);\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthis.recipesList.unshift(first);\n\t\t\t\t\t} else {\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthis.recipesList.unshift(data);\n\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t});\n\t}\n\tthis.closeForm(recipe.id);\n}\n```\n\n![](/src/images/rman_4.png)\n\nWe can now add, edit and remove recipes but they aren't very pretty and the formatting of the text\nis lost. In the next step we'll make it possible to write the recipe text in Markdown and then render it in HTML.\n\n## Step 3 - Markdown support\n\nFirst of all, let's install `showdown` - a nice JavaScript parser for Markdown:\n```bash\nnpm install showdown --save\nnpm install @types/showdown --save-dev\n```\nThen we import it in `home.component.ts`:\n```\nimport { Converter } from 'showdown';\n```\nFinally we'll implement a simple method called `md2html()` which will be used in our template.\n```ts\nmd2html(text: string): string {\n\treturn new Converter().makeHtml(text || '');\n}\n```\nIn our HTML template we call it like this:\n```html\n\u003Cdiv [innerHTML]=\"md2html(recipe.text)\">\u003C/div>\n```\nNow we render the text to HTML on the client and this allows us to write beautiful recipes like this:\n\n![](/src/images/rman_5.png)\n\n## Step 4 - Full-text search\n\nThe final feature left is the recipe search box. We'll use the built-in full-text search in Para. In `recipe.service.ts`:\n```ts\nsearch(q: string) {\n\treturn this.http.get(this.RECIPES_RESOURCE + '?q=' + q, this.options);\n}\n```\nAnd in `home.component.ts`:\n```ts\nsearch(): boolean {\n\tthis.recipeService.search(this.q || '*').subscribe((data: any) => {\n\t\tif (data.items) {\n\t\t\tthis.recipesList = data.items;\n\t\t}\n\t});\n\treturn false;\n}\n```\nFinally, we add the search box in the template below the heading:\n```html\n\u003Ch1>My Recipes &nbsp; \u003Cbutton (click)=\"newRecipeForm()\">Add\u003C/button>\u003C/h1>\n\u003Cdiv>\n  \u003Cform (submit)=\"search()\">\n    \u003Cinput type=\"text\" [(ngModel)]=\"q\" name=\"searchText\" placeholder=\"Search\">\n  \u003C/form>\n\u003C/div>\n```\n\nAnd we're done! Here's final result of our **Recipe Manager**\n(check out [the live demo](https://albogdano.github.io/angular2-para/)):\n\n![](/src/images/rman_6.png)\n\n## Final touches\n\nYou can see the result in your browser by running `ng serve`. Optionally, you can make this web application \"progressive\"\n(PWA) by adding the package `@angular/pwa` with `ng add @angular/pwa`. This will create a `manifest.json` and make the\npage available offline. Our code now passes the Lighthouse audit with flying colors!\n\n![](/src/images/rman_7.png)\n\nAll that is left is to build the project for production and deploy it:\n```\nng build --prod --base-href /angular2-para/\n# git push origin master\n```\n\n## Summary\n\nLearning Angular takes some time as it introduces a lot of architectural changes and new syntax.\nWriting in TypeScript feels fresh and more like writing in a modern statically typed language like C# or Java,\nrather than a dynamic language like JS. The `import` syntax was a bit hard for me to get used to, especially\nwith all the different files I had to navigate through. In general, the experience of writing Angular apps with the help\nof the new Angular CLI tool is great - the scaffolding just works, the build process is fast and painless,\nthe TypeScript syntax is clean, the app is well structured and the error messages are clear and understandable.\n\n**Things we did:**\n\n- generated a new project from scratch with Angular CLI\n- wrote a few fancy AJAX calls to our backend API\n- wired a bunch of simple TypeScript code between a component and a service\n- wrote some good old HTML and CSS\n- imported an external library with npm an typings\n\n**Things we didn't do:**\n\n- didn't write *any* backend code for CRUD operations on recipes\n- didn't define a schema for the \"recipe\" type on the server side\n\nThe complete code for this tutorial is on GitHub at [albogdano/angular2-para](https://github.com/albogdano/angular2-para).\nI've deployed the same code to GitHub pages as a [live demo](https://albogdano.github.io/angular2-para/) which\nis powered by our [cloud-based Para service](https://paraio.com).\n\n *Have questions or suggestions?

This was a highly-requested feature and it honestly\ntook more time than I anticipated but the end result is great.

Working with the platform is certainly\na level above Slack and Mattermost in terms of complexity. From a developer's perspective it is harder to navigate the\nhuge amount of documentation on the Microsoft Dev Center. A few simple features were hard to achieve like direct messages\nfrom bots to users and direct chat notifications (Microsoft calls those 'proactive messages').\n\nAfter a long coding session, I managed to get the integration up and running with just two of the Teams app features -\nbots and message extensions. Scoold connects to your Teams channel via a bot and users can issue commands from chat - they\ncan compose questions and answers, search for content, people and tags on Scoold and share those with other teammates.\nNotifications from Scoold to Teams are sent as proactive messages and there's even support for personal DMs when you \nsomebody comments on your posts in Scoold.\n\nYou can follow the [mini getting started page](https://scoold.com/teams.html) for detailed installation instructions.\nThe main steps to get Scoold working with Teams are as follows:\n\n1. Visit the Azure Poral and create an OAuth 2.0 web application client so that Scoold users can login with Microsoft\n2. Visit the [Teams Developer Portal](https://dev.teams.microsoft.com/bots) and create a new Bot from the \n\"Tools > Bot management\" page.\n3. Add the Bot ID and secret to your configuration file application.conf and restart Scoold:\n4. Visit the \"Administration\" page in Scoold and click the \"Add to Microsoft Teams\" button, then link any of your \nchannels to Scoold for notifications.\n5. Download the zipped app package and sideload it (click Import app) in \n[Teams Developer Portal > Apps](https://dev.teams.microsoft.com/apps) or directly add it to the Teams app catalog.\n6. Finally, click \"Publish your app\" to add it to your organization's app catalog. After approving the app in the \n[Teams Admin Center](https://admin.teams.microsoft.com/policies/manage-apps), you will then be able to install it as a \nTeams app for any of your teams.\n\n\n## The Scoold Bot\n\nA key part of the integration is the Scoold bot. Unfortunately Microsoft does not allow us to create bots programmatically \nas there's no API for that. So you'll have to create it manually. The good news is that it only takes a few clicks to \ncreate a new bot. Just visit the [Teams Developer Portal](https://dev.teams.microsoft.com/bots) and click \"+ New Bot\".\n\nThe Scoold Bot is simply an HTTP client application which talks to a trusted host (the Scoold server) and sends data to\nMicrosoft Teams. It is important that your bot is configured to trust the domain of your Scoold instance.\nYou can type `@Scoold help` to get a list of available commands. For example, you can quickly create a question by \nissuing the command `@Scoold ask How do I do X? Some more details...` and hitting Enter.\n\nYou can also update the bot icon and other bot properties at the [Bot Framework Portal](https://dev.botframework.com/bots) \nwhich is yet another page for managing bots (there are a total of 3 different ways to manage your bots!).\n\n## Message extensions\n\nMessage extensions allow you to search for content on Scoold and also give you a couple of shortcuts for creating questions\nand answers.\n\n![](/src/images/teams_intro1.png)\n\nYou can easily find any question, person or tag on Scoold without leaving the Teams chat window. Embedding content from Scoold\nis also supported, as well as link unfurling.\n\n![](/src/images/teams_intro3.png)\n\n## Easy installation\n\nScoold Pro will automatically generate the app package with the correct deteails filled in. Simply click \"Download app package\"\non the \"Administration\" page in Scoold.\nYou can easily install the Scoold app package by sideloading it directly to the Teams app catalog or you can import it into the\n[Teams Developer Portal > Apps](https://dev.teams.microsoft.com/apps).

We have about 10 paid customers from different parts of the globe - USA, Japan, Europe.\nPreviously, the hosted Para service was available from a single AWS region - Ireland, EU. This meant that clients\nconnecting from another continent would experience high latency for all requests to the backend, which would make\nPara applications feel slow. It was time to address this problem.\n\n\u003C!-- more -->\n\n![](/src/images/blogpost_media17.png)\n\n\n**Over the past month we expanded operations to two more regions - Tokyo, Japan and California, USA.** This means that\nPara is now a globally available backend service with high availability and on-demand scalability. This is really\nexciting news because we are the only independent BaaS provider to offer such level of service with simple and\npredictable pricing.\n\nPara BaaS relies heavily on **AWS DynamoDB** for data storage and benefits from its immense scalability and replication\nfeatures. We use global tables to replicate data across the three regions and on-demand scaling is enabled for\neach app table. Not only do we replicate the tables of paid apps, but even the free apps' data is globally replicated.\n\n**But what is cross-region replication?** Each Para app stores data in a dedicated DynamoDB table in a single region.\nWhen a request comes in from the same region or a nearby region (same continent), the latency is very good (\u003C 200ms).\nBut if a request from a far away region comes in, the latency can increase to about 800ms which is terrible.\nThis is where cross-region replication comes in. The table from region A is replicated to regions B and C and we\nhave carbon copies of that data in two more locations around the globe. Now, if a read request comes from region C,\nit fetches the data from that region locally. Similarly, a write request from region B is written to region B but also\nreplicated to regions A and C in real time. This type of replication is also know as\n[multi-master replication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-master_replication).\n\n**This all sounds great, but what about the full-text search indexes?** Para offers full-text search on all objects\nin the database which requires that data to be indexed and reindexed on each write request. Keeping the search\nindices in sync across all active regions is a challenge. We decided to keep operations as simple as possible and\nmanaged to synchronize the indices without complicating the architecture. With the help of AWS Simple Queue Service,\nPara sends special messages on each write request to a queue in each of the other active regions. Then each regional\ninstance of Para pulls those messages from the queue and updates its local search index by fetching the updated data\nfrom the local DynamoDB table. The process is simple, fast and scalable.\n\n## Simplified scaling\n\nThe hosted Para service used capacity credits to allow users to scale their app. Each pricing plan included a number\nof read and write credits and additional credits were available for purchase. If your Para app started to get more\ntraffic, you could buy more capacity credits and increase its throughput.\n\nNow, there is a better way to scale Para apps, thanks to the on-demand scaling feature in DynamoDB. It gives us\nfaster and automatic scaling of tables. We've enabled on-demand scaling for all existing apps, including all free apps.\nWith this change there is no need for capacity credits any more and we've removed them altogether.\n**So, you don't have to do anything to accommodate more traffic - your app simply scales automatically!**\n\n\n## Pricing changes\n\nFinally, we've decided that it's time to simplify our pricing. There will be a single pricing plan which will cost\n**€25 per app**. The new pricing will be in effect soon for new customers. Old customers will be charged the same\nprices as before. The currency is also changed from US Dollars to Euros because we are based in the EU.\n\nThe free plan is still available and lots of people use it for prototyping and building applications. The only change\nto this plan will be the new restriction of 10000 objects per app. Apps with more than 10K objects will be disabled\nuntil they upgrade to the paid plan.\n\n\n*Hey, I'm Alexander - an indie solo developer working on [Para](https://paraio.com) BaaS in the open.

The changes are minor and are mostly related \nto dependency upgrades. A few minor bugs have been fixed as well. Scoold has received some much welcome pull \nrequests with translations from our awesome contributors. It is now available in 12 different languages! \n\n\u003C!-- more -->\n\n![](/src/images/blogpost_media12.png)\n\nLast year came the release of Java 11 and we're quite happy to announce that both Scoold and Para are fully \ncompatible with JDK 11. This required that we upgrade most of the dependencies like Spring and Guice, for \nexample. \n\nThe latest release of Para is `1.31.1` and it contains a number of fixes. The code responsible for authenticating\nusers with LinkedIn has been updated and it's now compatible with their latest API v2.0. We recommend that you \nupdate your Para server to 1.31.1` if you're using LinkedIn.\n\nSAML authentication has been a desired feature for some time so we've implemented it as part of the Para backend.\nHence, [Scoold PRO](https://www.scoold.com/) and all Para clients can take advantage of that and authenticate users \nthrough any given SAML IDP. This, coupled with existing LDAP support, makes it effortless for enterprise customers\nto integrate their own identity provider with Para and Scoold.\n\nThe latest release of Scoold is `1.31.2`. The cookie security has been tightened with the addition of the new \n`SameSite` flag which is supposed to completely mitigate the risk of a possible CSRF attack. For better protection\nagainst XSS attacks, we've also upgraded the template engine, Velocity, to 2.0. \n\nScoold now comes in a WAR package as well. This makes it easy to deploy on a servlet container such as Apache Tomcat.\nThe JAR package is more appropriate for deploying Scoold to hosts without a servlet container, as it includes an\ninstance of the embedded Jetty server. This is the case for Heroku, for example.\n\nApart from Heroku, we've added support and documentation for lots of other deployment options — AWS, Azure, \nDigitalOcean and Google App Engine. Not only that, but we've added a new `helm/` folder with a Helm chart for those\nof you who want to deploy Scoold to a Kubernetes cluster with a single command:\n\n```\nhelm install --name my-scoold ./scoold\n```\n\nRead the [Scoold chart README](https://github.com/Erudika/scoold/tree/master/helm) for more details on how to \nconfigure the pod.\n\nPara does not yet include a Helm chart because it has lots of different database combinations and it's hard to choose\nthe best option for everyone. It is available on Docker Hub and so is Scoold. To run a Para server locally with\nDocker, simply run:\n\n```\ndocker run -ti -p 8080:8080 --rm -v para-data:/para/data \\\n  -v $(pwd)/application.conf:/para/application.conf \\\n  -e JAVA_OPTS=\"-Dconfig.file=/para/application.conf\" erudikaltd/para\n```\n\nTo run just Scoold locally, try:\n\n```\ndocker run -ti -p 8000:8000 --rm -v $(pwd)/application.conf:/scoold/application.conf \\\n  -e JAVA_OPTS=\"-Dconfig.file=/scoold/application.conf\" erudikaltd/scoold\n```\n\nOr, to run both Para and Scoold locally with Docker use the `docker-compose` command from inside the Scoold folder:\n\n```\ndocker-compose up\n```\n\nEach release of Para and Scoold has a tag and that tag is reflected on Docker Hub. So you can fetch a particular tag and\nrun that, or use the `:latest` tag which contains the most recent updates from the `master` branch. You can see all the \ncontainers available on [our Docker Hub page](https://hub.docker.com/u/erudikaltd), which includes all the Para plugins\nas well.\n\n## Lucene S3 Directory\n\nFinally, we'd like to announce the availability of a new experimental project called \n[lucene-s3directory](https://github.com/albogdano/lucene-s3directory). It's a `Directory` implementation for Apache\nLucene which allows you to store your indices directly on AWS S3. This has been attempted before by Shay Banon (creator \nof Elasticsearch and Compass) but he later abandoned the project because S3 didn't have support for locks back then.\nSince late 2018, S3 now supports two different types of locks on objects - legal hold locks and retention periods. \nThe `S3Directory` implementation uses legal hold locks on `write.lock` files. \n\nThe project passes the integration tests but it might still contain some bugs. We'd really appreciate it if you take it\nfor a spin and report any issues on [GitHub](https://github.com/albogdano/lucene-s3directory/issues).","src/content/blog/Status-update-containers-Java-11-and-more.md","4749c8790526ac0f",{"html":418,"metadata":419},"\u003Cp>Over the past couple of months we’ve been busy maintaining \u003Ca href=\"https://paraio.org\">Para\u003C/a> and\n\u003Ca href=\"https://scoold.com\">Scoold\u003C/a> and a few patches have been released.

This feature is available now \non [ParaIO.com](https://paraio.com) as well. This is very good news for everyone who wants to integrate Para with\nexternal services. It makes Para even more flexible and enables you to have near real-time notifications for events\nlike `create`, `update` and `delete` for any object type you choose.\n\n\u003C!-- more -->\n\n![](/src/images/blogpost_media13.png)\n\nWebhooks are essentially `POST` requests made from Para to a destination URL of your choice. The destination has to\nbe able to process the request and return `200 OK`. This is a much more efficient way of communication and is well\nsummarized by the phrase **Don’t call us, we’ll call you!**.\n\n\u003Cpre>\n      Client\n      +----------------------------------------------+\n      +----------------------------------------------+\n                     ^             |\n                     |             |\n         Here's some |             | OK! 10x!\n         new data!   |             |\n                     |             v\n      +----------------------------------------------+\n      +----------------------------------------------+\n      Server\n\n+-------------------------------------------------------->\n                           Time\n\u003C/pre>\n\nThe implementation is fully asynchronous and uses a queue for decoupling the message publishing from the actual \nprocessing and delivery of payloads. There's also a `LocalQueue` implementation which holds messages in memory and a \n`LocalRiver` (worker) which periodically pulls messages from the queue and forwards them to their destinations. \nThe `AWSQueue` class implements webhooks processing based on [AWS SQS](https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/) queues and \nis recommended for production use. Any other queue server can be potentially supported via a plugin which implements \nthe `Queue` interface.\n\nWebhooks can be enabled in Para by adding `para.webhooks_enabled = true` in your `application.conf`. The same applies\nfor Scoold where they are enabled by default.\n\nIt's quite easy to subscribe to any event triggered by Para. There are 6 event types: `update`, `create`, `delete`, \n`updateAll`, `createAll`, `deleteAll`. These are triggered by their respective mutating operations on objects.\nFor example, a webhook might be a registered for all `update` events in Para, and also it might only be interested in \nupdated `user` objects. So we can register a new webhook like so:\n\n```\nPOST /v1/webhooks\n{\n  \"urlEncoded\": true,\n  \"update\": true,\n  \"targetUrl\": \"https://destination.url\",\n  \"secret\": \"secret\",\n  \"typeFilter\":\"user\"\n}\n```\n\nIf you don't want to use the API, simply open the web console and register your webhook with the simple user interface.\n\n![](/src/images/para_webhooks1.png)\n\nOf course, Para allows you to register multiple destination URLs so you can essentially receive identical event at two\ndifferent places. You can also register webhooks which are subscribed to all events on all types in Para:\n```\nPOST /v1/webhooks\n{\n  \"active\": true,\n  \"urlEncoded\": true,\n  \"update\": true,\n  \"create\": true,\n  \"delete\": true,\n  \"updateAll\": true,\n  \"createAll\": true,\n  \"deleteAll\": true,\n  \"targetUrl\": \"https://destination.url\",\n  \"secret\": \"secret\",\n  \"typeFilter\":\"*\"\n}\n```\nIf the typeFilter is either blank or `*`, all selected events will be sent to the destination, regardless of the object\ntype.\n\nAll webhook payloads are signed by Para using `HmacSHA256` and each `Webhook` object has its own secret key. Securing webhooks\nthis way is essential because clients can verify the signature and check if the request is actually coming from Para rather than\na third party. It is highly recommended that you verify the signature of each payload contained in the `X-Webhook-Signature`\nheader. \n\nIf a client is not responding to `POST` requests, Para will try again several times before giving up and eventually that \ndestination URL will be disabled. However, you can always correct the URL and reenable the webhook. \n\nEach payload has a specific format which is similar to the other JSON responses of the Para REST API.\nHere's an sample payload when URL-decoded:\n```\n{\n  \"appid\": \"myapp\",\n  \"event\": \"create\",\n  \"timestamp\": 1486848081865,\n  \"items\": [{}, ...]\n}\n```\nThe `items` field can contain one or more `ParaObject` objects which are the result of that particular event.\n\nAnd the cool thing about webhooks in Para is that all clients can benefit from that immediately, without much effort.\nIn Scoold, for example, we've added webhooks support with a minimal amount of code. You can now listen to `create`\nevents on the `question` type, for example, to get notified when somebody asks a new question. \n\n*You can start playing with webhooks right away, by signing up for a free account on [Para](https://paraio.com) - \nour fully managed backend service for busy developers.

It is powered by Java and was released in early 2014. Out of the box, Para\nintegrates with Elasticsearch and DynamoDB and Hazelcast but developers are not limited to using these defaults.\nThe design is flexible enough so that anyone can implement the interfaces for search, persistence and caching functionality.\nApart from DynamoDB, we have connectors for [MongoDB](https://github.com/Erudika/para-dao-mongodb) and\n[Cassandra](https://github.com/Erudika/para-dao-cassandra). We're planning to include support for PostgreSQL as well.\n\nPara is focused on simplicity and flexibility and it can host multiple apps on a single server. Although you can use\nit to power your mobile backend, we wanted to make the framework simpler by providing the core functionality and thus\nwe created a general-purpose BaaS. Some of our clients are using it as an API server for their Angular frontend, while\nothers use it as an alternative to Parse for their mobile development.\n\nThe [documentation](https://paraio.org/docs) is great, contained in a single webpage for easy navigation and API methods\nare described clearly. Getting started is pretty easy - download the executable WAR package and run it:\n```bash\n$ java -jar para-x.y.z.war\n$ curl localhost:8080/v1/_setup\n```\nThis will give you the keys needed for making authenticated requests to the server using any of our API clients.\nIf you wish to integrate Para with your own code, there's a package on Maven central - just search for `para-server`.\nThe WAR file can also be deployed to inside a servlet container like Tomcat.\n\nThe core API consists of three main interfaces for searching, storing and caching object. Implement those and you\nhave your own custom server. The data model is simple and all classes implement the `ParaObject` interface. This gives\nthem some basic properties like `id`, `type` and `name`. Entities can link to other entities by forming one-to-one,\none-to-many and many-to-many relationships. Basic constraint checkers, such as `required`, `min`, `max`, `regexp`,\ncan be used to validate object properties. Full-text search is enabled by default for all objects.\n\nAuthentication between clients and the server is not based on OAuth, [intentionally](http://hueniverse.com/2012/07/26/oauth-2-0-and-the-road-to-hell/).\nInstead we implement the simple and robust AWS Signature 4 algorithm for signed requests. User management, fine-grained\npermissions and support for JSON Web Tokens are available since version 1.17. Para also has built-in support for third-party\nauthentication with Facebook, Twitter, Google, GitHub, LinkedIn, Microsoft, Slack, as well as any OAuth 2.0 server.\nIt also supports LDAP, Active Directory and SAML.\n\nPara is a good choice if you are building a cloud-based web service and it's great for rapid prototyping.\nIt's an easy-to-use and flexible platform that scales well. A backend for busy developers.\n\n## BaasBox - [\u003Ci class=\"fa fa-github-square\">\u003C/i>](https://github.com/baasbox/baasbox)\n\u003Cimg src=\"/src/images/baasbox.png\">\n\n**Multitenant:** yes, [since v0.8.4](http://www.baasbox.com/the-importance-of-managing-multiple-apps-with-one-backend) \u003Cbr>\n**Language:** Java \u003Cbr>\n**Database:** OrientDB \u003Cbr>\n**Documentation:** 8/10 \u003Cbr>\n**Client libraries:** Android/Java, iOS, JavaScript \u003Cbr>\n**Status:** \u003Ci class=\"fa fa-warning\">\u003C/i> Unmaintained (last commit on GitHub was in Dec. 2015.)\n\nBaasBox is another mBaaS with a nice web-based admin console. It supports everything a mobile developer would\nneed to run a backend server. It's been around since early 2013. It provides good support for Android and iOS\nclients and JavaScript.\n\nThe docs are very nice and detailed, very easy to navigate. Getting started is very easy - unzip the file and run\nthe Bash/bat script and you open up the console on `localhost:9000/console`.  The server is running on top of OrientDB\nwhich is sort of a hybrid database and has a lot of cool features.\n\nBaasBox is easy to learn and has a nice REST API that speaks JSON. It's got full support for CRUD operations on objects\nand collections of objects and also allows you to link them in one-to-many or many-to-many relationships. Social\nfeatures are excellent - you have social login, friendship/followers API and user management. Other features include\nfiles and assets API, push notifications and a plugin system.\n\n\n## [Deployd](https://deployd.com) - [\u003Ci class=\"fa fa-github-square\">\u003C/i>](https://github.com/deployd/deployd)\n\u003Cimg src=\"/src/images/deployd.png\" style=\"border: 1px solid #CCCCCC\">\n\n**Multitenant:** no \u003Cbr>\n**Language:** JavaScript \u003Cbr>\n**Database:** MongoDB \u003Cbr>\n**Documentation:** 6/10 \u003Cbr>\n**Client libraries:** none \u003Cbr>\n**Status:** \u003Ci class=\"fa fa-warning\">\u003C/i> Unmaintained (last release was in April 2019)\n\nDeployd is an API building platform for Node.js and runs on top of MongoDB. It's been around since 2012. The cool\nthing about it is its web dashboard and the CLI tool called `dpd`. The framework, it seems, was designed to be used\nas part of your project only, i.e. not as a standalone external API server, and has no client libraries available\n(tell me if I'm wrong!).\n\nThe project is well documented and has plenty of examples and code. They have dedicated installers for Windows and Mac\nthat will help you get started. To create a new project you run `$ dpd create my-app` and then start the server\nwith `dpd -d`. That's it.\n\nDeployd plays well with other JavaScript frameworks like AngularJS and Backbone.js. It has great support for\ncollections (plain old JS objects) and events. Events can be emitted and processed easily. User management is\nbuilt-in. Other functionality like social login support is provided by third-party modules.\n\n\n## [Telepat](https://telepat.io) - [\u003Ci class=\"fa fa-github-square\">\u003C/i>](https://github.com/telepat-io/telepat-api)\n\u003Cimg src=\"/src/images/telepat.png\">\n\n**Multitenant:** yes \u003Cbr>\n**Language:** JavaScript \u003Cbr>\n**Database:** agnostic \u003Cbr>\n**Documentation:**  6/10 \u003Cbr>\n**Client libraries:** Android, iOS, JavaScript \u003Cbr>\n**Status:** \u003Ci class=\"fa fa-warning\">\u003C/i> Unmaintained (last commit was in 2017)\n\nTelepat is the youngest framework of the bunch. It's a realtime data sync solution for mobile and other applications.\nIt's fairly new -  first released in 2015. The framework is focused on realtime push and flexibility. It's database\nagnostic but seems to be designed to work with NoSQL databases like Couchbase. Search is\nimplemented on top of Elasticsearch.\n\nThe documentation is a work in progress but looks great. The early stage of the project means that we should\nexpect some changes to the API. Getting started requires you to launch Elasticsearch, Redis and Kafka servers\nfirst but they provide a nice Docker package that will help you with that.\n\nThe API is simple with CRUD methods for users and applications. User management is supported and authentication is\nimplemented with passwords and tokens.\n\nTelepat is really new but shows a lot of potential. Lots of new features are planned and others are almost finished\nlike push notifications. It's well worth checking out especially if you're building realtime apps.\n\n\n## Summary\n\nWe've shown how developers can leverage open source backend frameworks to accelerate time-to-market and enhance\ntheir products' security and scalability. While some frameworks cater to mobile developers and make very specific\nchoices in terms of technology stack, other try to have broader use cases and be database-agnostic.\n\nIn order to decide which BaaS package is best for your project, start by defining its scope and platform - is it\ngoing to be a mobile app or a website, for example. Then choose the framework that has the best documentation and\nclient library for your specific platform and language - C#, Java, Javascript, etc. Finally get the code and run it\nlocally on your development machine and give it a try.\n\nHappy coding!","src/content/blog/backend-frameworks-usergrid-loopback-para-baasbox-deployd-telepat.md","2e82fc55c8894709",{"html":504,"metadata":505},"\u003Cp>Let’s compare some modern open source backend frameworks that are available today.\nThese frameworks handle the server-side operations of your website or app. Developers use them to build and\niterate on products faster than ever before by focusing on the “fun” part - the frontend (client-side).\nThis blog post will be a comparison between open source frameworks only and does not aim to cover all backend\nservices on the market.\u003C/p>\n\u003C!-- more -->\n\u003Cp>The communication between your front-end code and the backend is usually done through HTTP(S) and the data is usually\nin the form of JSON objects that are sent back and forth.

In particular,\nScoold has received hundreds of bug fixes and dozens of pull requests on GitHub. The community has been quite\nactive with feature requests and suggestions.\nWe're also happy to report that profits from Scoold Pro are increasing and we're proud to have several large clients,\nlike Cisco, IBM and DBS Bank, who have successfully deployed it in production.\n\n\u003C!-- more -->\n\n![](/src/images/blogpost_media15.png)\n\n## Python Client for Para\n\nThe big news around Para is the availability of the new Para client written in Python. This has been a feature request\nfor a while now and we finally shipped it in February of 2020. The Python ecosystem is evergrowing and we're happy\nto support one of the most popular programming environments out there.\n\nYou can quickly install the Python client from PyPi by executing the following command:\n\n```sh\n$ pip3 install paraclient\n```\n\nThen you import the library like this:\n\n```python\nfrom paraclient import ParaClient\n\nparaclient = ParaClient('ACCESS_KEY', 'SECRET_KEY');\n```\n\nPull requests and bug reports are more than welcome on the [project's page on GitHub](https://github.com/Erudika/para-client-python).\n\n## Scoold Pro integrated with Slack and Mattermost\n\nFirst we added integration between Scoold Pro and Slack in version `1.33.0` last summer. It allows you to connect\nScoold Pro to a number of Slack teams and channels. You can directly map Slack channels to Scoold spaces.\nOnce you authorize the selected channels, Scoold Pro will start sending in-chat notifications for key events\nlike the creation of a new question or answer, or whenever somebody on your team was mentioned in a Scoold post.\n\nNot only that, but you can ask and answer questions directly from Slack, using the `/scoold` slash command.\nAsking a question on Slack is as easy as writing `/scoold ask How do I do X?`. To answer, simply type in\n`/scoold answer [question URL] Here's my answer...`. You can also turn any chat message into a Scoold question\nor answer by using the special message actions. If you wish to compose a longer post you can open up a special\ndialog box, where you can write longer text.\n\nApproving questions and answers without leaving the channel is another handy feature for moderators who wish to\nkeep an eye on new posts on Scoold. If new posts require explicit approval from moderators, Scoold Pro will notify\nthe chat by presenting the option to \"Approve\" or \"Delete\" the newly created post.\n\nThen, around Xmas 2019 we released the Mattermost integration. Mattermost is the open source Slack alternative which\ncan be self-hosted and is used by a huge number of companies. Scoold Pro integrates with Mattermost in exactly the\nthe same way as with Slack and the two integrations have identical features. The only difference is that the\nintegration with Mattermost is part of Scoold Pro rather than Para. This means that Scoold can be installed behind\na firewall and still connect to a local instance of Mattermost even if the Para backend is hosted elsewhere on\na public cloud.\n\nThere are lots of other nice features so be sure to check out the [Scoold Pro + Slack](https://scoold.com/slack.html)\nand [Scoold Pro + Mattermost](https://scoold.com/mattermost.html) web pages for more information.\n\n## Scoold API\n\nThe long-awaited RESTful API is finally available in Scoold `1.38.0` (for both OSS and Pro). I has been in development\nfor a few months now and was long overdue. You can check out the [Swagger documentation](https://demo.scoold.com/apidocs)\nfor the full list of API resources. There are no API clients at the moment but you can easily generate one from\nthe [API schema](https://demo.scoold.com/api.json), using [Swagger Codegen](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-codegen/).\n\nThis is a fully-fledged API, meaning you can execute all read and write operations in Scoold programmatically. It is\nmuch easier to call the Scoold API and create a new question, for example, than to call the Para API and construct\nthe question object manually. This is because there are extra steps and logic behind each and every Scoold task, like\ncreating a new post or user.\n\nWhen combined with webhooks, the Scoold API allows you to create complex and powerful integrations for the needs of\nyour organization. See the [README](https://github.com/Erudika/scoold#rest-api) to learn more.\n\n## Backup and restore\n\nAnother important new feature has landed in Scoold `1.37.0` and that is the ability to create full copies of the Scoold\ndatabase which can later be restored. Scoold administrators can download zipped copies of the data from the\n\"Administration\" page. Each ZIP archive contains a number of JSON files which contain the data extracted from Para for\nthe corrsponding Scoold application.\n\nTo restore a previously created backup, simply select a ZIP archive and click the \"Import\" button. You can also\nimport a single JSON file containing one or more Para objects. This is useful in situations where you only want\nto do a partial restore of some of the objects.\n\n## Themes\n\nAnd finally, we've improved the customizabitly of Scoold with support for custom theming and 5 ready-to-use themes.\nThere's also a new dark mode. Take a look:\n\n![](/src/images/dark_mode.png)\n\nScoold administrators can create custom themes by modifying the CSS of an existing theme or by creating a custom\nstylesheet from scratch.\n\n*You can download Scoold from [Scoold.com](https://scoold.com) and sign up for a free account on [Para](https://paraio.com) -\nour fully managed backend service, supporting multiple Scoold instances.

Last week we pushed the new version to Maven and now it's also\ndeployed on [ParaIO.com](https://paraio.com), our hosted backend service.\n\n\u003C!-- more -->\n\nWe've worked hard during the holidays to bring you several new features that will enable you to integrate Para in\nprojects that are client-side only like static web pages or mobile applications.\n\nHere are all the new features in Para v1.17:\n\n\u003C!--\nAdded JSON Web Tokens support\nAdded methods to grant and revoke permissions for users\nFixed Maven's JAR and WAR assembly - there's a single 'fat' executable WAR now\nUpdated Elasticsearch to v2.1.1\nUpdated design & added features to web console\n-->\n\n## JSON Web Tokens support\n\n![](/src/images/blogpost_media2.png)\n\n[JSON Web Tokens](https://jwt.io/) are a new standard for authenticating clients and users. Think of them as\n'Cookies 2.0'. They are simply a signed JSON object containing some data about the authenticated user. The cool thing\nabout JWTs is that they are stateless and can be stored anywhere - cookies, local storage, memory, etc. They can securely\nstore information and claims about the user and that information is signed and cannot be tampered with.\n\nOriginally, Para supported only cookies and allowed users to sign in only to the server running Para.\nThis was quite limiting. Now with JWTs users can be authenticated and created per app\n(see [the docs for apps](https://paraio.org/docs/#011-apps)) through the API.\nCookies are still supported but using web tokens is recommended. For example, to sign in a user with\nFacebook you have to make a request like this:\n\n```js\nPOST /jwt_auth\n{\n  \"appid\": \"app:myapp\",\n  \"provider\": \"facebook\",\n  \"token\": \"eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eWIiO...\"\n}\n```\n\nThe token above is a Facebook access token which is exchanged for a Para access token in the form of JWT.\nIf that request succeeds, the access token for Para is returned and that user is now authenticated with `app:myapp`.\n\n```js\n{\n  \"jwt\": {\n    \"access_token\": \"eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJ...\",\n    \"expires\": 1450137214490,\n    \"refresh\": 1450137216490\n  },\n  \"user\": {\n    \"id\":\"user1\",\n    \"timestamp\": 1399721289987,\n    \"type\":\"user\",\n    \"appid\":\"myapp\",\n    ...\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThat's it - there's no need to register the user. And this request can come from any client not just the backend.\nAn good use case would be an AngularJS app running on its own as a static single page app (SPA). The frontend code would\nuse our JavaScript client library to call `signIn()` to the Para backend server. Another use case could be a mobile app\nrunning native Android code. The app's code, even though compiled, is not trusted and thus must not contain any\nAPI access credentials like a `secret_key` for Para. In this case JWT is ideal because it gives that app (untrusted client)\ntemporary access to the API. Para access tokens are valid for one week, by default.\n\nSpecial thanks to the guys at [Connect2ID](https://connect2id.com/products/nimbus-jose-jwt) for their excellent JWT\nlibrary for Java which we use in Para.\n\n## Resource permissions\n\nSoon after we decided to add JWT support, we realized that once a user has been authenticated with an app we need to\nspecify what that user can do, so we implemented basic resource permissions. By default users are not trusted and every\nnew app has zero permissions - the default policy is `deny all`. This is in contrast to the normal API access using a\n`secret_key` for apps, in which case apps have full permissions and privileged access.\n\nResource permissions affect only users with JWT tokens and are stored in each app object. A permission has three parts -\na `subject_id`, a `resource_name` and a list of `methods`. It looks like this:\n\n```js\n{\n  \"user2\": {\n    \"posts\": [\"GET\", \"POST\"]\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis gives a subject with id `user2` permissions to access resource `posts` using HTTP methods `GET` and `POST` only.\nThe `posts` resource is just an example an is part of the API and is located at `/v1/posts`. Wildcards `*` are also\nsupported. So the following permission would give everyone full access to all resources for a given app:\n\n```js\n{\n  \"*\": {\n    \"*\": [\"*\"]\n  }\n}\n```\n\nPermissions can be granted and revoked through the API. There's also a method for checking permissions:\n\n```txt\nGET /v1/_permissions/{subjectid}/{resource}/{method}\n```\n\n## Support for Elasticsearch 2.x\n\nElasticseach is a key component of the Para backend server and we use it since version 0.13. With version 2.0 come many\nnew features and changes. We've modified and tested the code to be compatible with the new version.\n\nYou can [download the latest WAR file from GitHub](https://github.com/Erudika/para/releases/).\nTo run it just type `java -jar para-war.war` and it will start.\n\n** We hope you will like the new features and feel free to try Para online at [paraio.com](https://paraio.com).\nNo need to install anything and it's free.**","src/content/blog/para-1-17-released.md","4517b067607be153",{"html":605,"metadata":606},"\u003Cp>We’re happy to announce the release of Para v1.17.
