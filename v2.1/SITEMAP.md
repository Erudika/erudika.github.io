Below is an **SEO-optimized page and information architecture** tailored specifically for **Erudika**, its existing content, products, and target audience (developers, CTOs, SaaS buyers). This structure is designed for **Astro static generation**, **GitHub Pages**, and strong **topical authority** without unnecessary pages.

I’m not generating copy yet—this is the **structural blueprint** you should implement as Astro pages and Markdown collections.

---

## 1. Top-Level Sitemap (Primary SEO Pages)

These pages target **high-intent commercial and branded queries**.

```
/
├─ /about/
├─ /projects/
├─ /support/
├─ /blog/
├─ /contact/
├─ /privacy/
├─ /terms/
└─ /status/ (external link)
```

### `/` — Homepage (Core Authority Page)

**SEO role:** Brand + broad commercial intent

Targets:

* “Erudika”
* “backend services company”
* “open source backend tools”
* “Scoold”, “Para backend”

Key sections:

* H1: *A tiny software company*
* Value proposition (cloud + open source)
* Featured products (cards → internal links)
* Trust signals (years active, OSS usage)
* Blog highlights (internal linking)
* Contact CTA

Schema:

* `Organization`
* `Website`

---

### `/about/` — Company & Trust Page

**SEO role:** E-E-A-T (Experience, Expertise, Authority, Trust)

Targets:

* “Erudika company”
* “Erudika Bulgaria”
* “backend software company Europe”

Sections:

* Company mission
* Open-source philosophy
* Legal entity details (already on site)
* Founder attribution (without personal data overexposure)

Schema:

* `Organization`
* `Person` (optional, for founder)

---

## 2. Product & Solution Pages (Most Important SEO Cluster)

### `/projects/` — Products Overview (Hub Page)

**SEO role:** Internal linking hub + commercial discovery

Targets:

* “Erudika products”
* “open source backend tools”

Sections:

* Open Source
* Cloud Services
* Self-Hosted / Enterprise

Each product **must** have its own page.

---

### Individual Product Pages (High-Value Pages)

```
/projects/para/
/projects/scoold/
/projects/para-cloud/
/projects/scoold-cloud/
/projects/scoold-pro/
/projects/robo-translator/
```

Each page should include:

* H1 with product name
* What problem it solves
* Key features
* Deployment options
* Who it’s for
* Links to docs / GitHub
* Internal links to related products
* CTA (Cloud / Self-Hosted / Support)

Schema:

* `SoftwareApplication`
* `Product`
* `FAQPage` (if FAQs included)

⚠️ These pages will carry **most organic traffic value**.

---

## 3. Support & Commercial Pages

### `/support/` — Support & Pricing

**SEO role:** Transactional intent

Targets:

* “Erudika support”
* “Scoold support”
* “Para support pricing”

Sections:

* Support plans
* Priority support explanation

Schema:

## 4. Blog & Content Marketing (Topical Authority)

Features:

---

### `/blog/[slug]/` — Blog Post Pages (Markdown)

Each post:

* Optimized H1
* Strong intro paragraph
* Internal links to products
* Table of contents (if long)
* Author/date visible

Schema:

* `Article`
* `BlogPosting`

---

### Optional but Highly Recommended

```
/blog/tags/[tag]/
/blog/category/[category]/
```

These generate **indexable landing pages** for long-tail keywords.

---

## 5. SEO Power Pages (Optional but Valuable)

These are optional but **excellent for SEO** if you want to grow traffic.

```
/use-cases/
/use-cases/q-and-a-platform/
/use-cases/backend-as-a-service/
/use-cases/open-source-saas/
```

Purpose:

* Capture intent-based searches
* Funnel traffic to product pages

Schema:

* `WebPage`
* `FAQPage`

---

## 6. Legal & Crawling Pages (Required)

### `/privacy/`

### `/terms/`

SEO notes:

* Required for trust
* Linked in footer
* Noindex optional (but usually fine to index)

---

### `/sitemap.xml`

* Auto-generated by Astro
* Includes blog posts, products, tags

### `/robots.txt`

* Allow all
* Reference sitemap

---

## 7. Internal Linking Strategy (Critical)

Every page should link:

* **Up** → its parent (breadcrumbs)
* **Across** → related products or blog posts
* **Down** → deeper content

Example:

* Blog post → links to `/projects/scoold/`
* Product page → links to `/support/`
* Homepage → links to `/projects/` and `/blog/`

Add:

* Breadcrumb navigation (`BreadcrumbList` schema)

---

## 8. URL & SEO Conventions

* Lowercase URLs
* Hyphen-separated slugs
* No query parameters
* Canonical URLs everywhere
* Preserve existing URLs where possible

---

## 9. Astro Implementation Mapping (High Level)

```
src/pages/
  index.astro
  about.astro
  contact.astro
  support.astro
  projects/
    index.astro
    para.astro
    scoold.astro
    ...
  blog/
    index.astro
    [...slug].astro
content/
  blog/
    *.md
```

---

## Summary

This structure:

* Maximizes **SEO surface area**
* Builds **topical authority** around backend + OSS
* Avoids thin or duplicate pages
* Is perfectly suited for **Astro + Markdown + static hosting**

If you want, next I can:

* Map **keywords → pages**
* Design **JSON-LD schemas per page**
* Generate **Astro layouts for SEO (Head, Breadcrumbs, OG)**
* Create a **content migration checklist page-by-page**

Just tell me which one to do next.
