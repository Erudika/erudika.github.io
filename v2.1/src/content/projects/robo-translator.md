With the power of OpenAI and Azure Cognitive Services, I brought this project to life in about three weeks. The goal of Robo Translator is to simplify the way you localize content, any content - text, audio, or video. Whether you use it once or whenever you create a new piece of content, Robo Translator will be your trusty assistant without nagging you about a monthly bill. The pricing is super simple - pay only for what you use!

Use Robo Translator to supercharge your content by localizing it to reach your global audience. Robo Translator — designed to make language barriers a thing of the past!

# Features

- **Machine Translation**: Translate any audio, video or text document into one or more languages. Powered by the latest OpenAI models, Robo Translator is a highly accurate localization tool.

- **Closed Caption Localization**: Auto-translate captions (subtitles) from any YouTube video, in seconds. Synthesize audio tracks in a language of your choice and then import them in YouTube Studio, as multi-language audio.

- **Audio Transcription and Translation**: Turn any audio track into a localized copy of itself. Robo Translator will transcribe the audio, generate captions for it and synthesize a new audio track with one click!

- **Software Localization**: Want to translate those language files for your mobile or web app? No problemo! Robo Translator can work with popular l11n formats like `.xml`, `.json`, `.plist`, `.php`, `.properties`, and more.
